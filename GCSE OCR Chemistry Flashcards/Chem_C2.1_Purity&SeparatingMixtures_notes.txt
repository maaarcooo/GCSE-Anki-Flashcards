What is a pure substance in scientific terms? | A single element or compound, not mixed with any other substance.
How is "pure" defined in everyday language compared to scientific use? | In everyday language, "pure" means something that has had nothing added to it (natural, unadulterated), while scientifically it means a single element or compound.
How can you distinguish pure from impure substances using melting point? | Pure substances melt and boil at specific temperatures, while impure substances melt and boil over a range of temperatures.
What is relative formula mass (Mr)? | The sum of the relative atomic masses of all the atoms shown in the formula.
How can you verify that a chemical equation is balanced using relative formula mass? | The sum of Mr of reactants in quantities shown must equal the sum of Mr of products in quantities shown.
What is relative atomic mass? | The ratio of the average mass of one atom of an element to 1/12th of the mass of a carbon-12 atom.
What is relative molecular mass? | The ratio of the average mass of one molecule of an element or compound to 1/12th of the mass of a carbon-12 atom.
What is the empirical formula of a compound? | The simplest whole number ratio of atoms of each element in a molecule.
How do you find the empirical formula from a molecular formula? | Divide the number of atoms of each element by their highest common factor.
What is a formulation? | A mixture that has been designed as a useful product with specific properties.
Give three examples of formulations. | Medicines, sunscreens, and paints (also acceptable: food and drink products, perfumes).
Why are most metals used in everyday life actually alloys rather than pure metals? | Because pure copper, gold, iron and aluminum are too soft for everyday uses, so they are mixed with small amounts of similar metals to make them harder.
What separation technique would you use to separate an insoluble salt (precipitate) from a solution? | Filtration.
How is crystallisation used to obtain a soluble salt from solution? | 1) Warm the solution to evaporate solvent until saturated, 2) Allow to cool, 3) Collect and dry the crystals that form.
What is simple distillation used for? | To separate a solvent from a solution, useful for producing water from salt solution.
Why does simple distillation work to separate salt water? | Because the dissolved solute (salt) has a much higher boiling point than the solvent (water).
What is fractional distillation used for? | To separate a mixture of liquids with different boiling points.
How does a fractionating column work in the oil industry? | Heated crude oil is piped in at the bottom, vaporized oil rises up the column, and fractions with similar carbon atoms condense at different levels where they are tapped off.
What are the two phases involved in chromatography? | A stationary phase and a mobile phase.
What are the stationary and mobile phases in paper chromatography? | Stationary phase: paper; Mobile phase: solvent.
What are the stationary and mobile phases in thin layer chromatography (TLC)? | Stationary phase: thin layer of inert substance on flat surface; Mobile phase: solvent.
What are the stationary and mobile phases in gas chromatography? | Stationary phase: liquid/solid on solid support; Mobile phase: inert carrier gas.
How is the Rf value calculated in chromatography? | Rf value = distance moved by substance ÷ distance moved by solvent.
How can you use chromatography to distinguish pure from impure substances? | A pure compound produces a single spot, while compounds in a mixture separate into different spots.
What happens when a substance is more soluble in paper chromatography? | The more soluble a substance is, the further up the paper it travels.
How does the distribution of substances between phases affect separation in chromatography? | Substances with different solubilities in the mobile and stationary phases move at different rates, causing separation.
