What is an exothermic reaction? | A reaction that transfers energy to the surroundings, causing the temperature of the surroundings to increase.
Give three examples of exothermic reactions. | Combustion, many oxidation reactions, and neutralization.
What are two everyday applications of exothermic reactions? | Self-heating cans (e.g., for coffee) and hand warmers.
What is an endothermic reaction? | A reaction that takes in energy from the surroundings, causing the temperature of the surroundings to decrease.
Give two examples of endothermic reactions. | Thermal decomposition and the reaction between citric acid and sodium hydrogencarbonate.
What is a practical application of endothermic reactions? | Some sports injury packs are based on endothermic reactions.
What is required for chemical reactions to occur? | Reacting particles must collide with each other and with sufficient energy.
What is activation energy? | The minimum amount of energy that particles must have to react.
What does a reaction profile show? | It shows the relative energies of reactants and products, the activation energy, and the overall energy change of a reaction.
What does the arrow in a reaction profile represent? | The overall energy change of the reaction.
(HT) What energy changes occur during a chemical reaction? | Energy is taken in to break bonds in the reactants, and energy is released when bonds in the products are formed.
(HT) How do you calculate the overall energy change in a chemical reaction? | Sum of energy to break bonds MINUS sum of energy released when bonds form.
(HT) When is a reaction endothermic in terms of bond energies? | When the energy needed to break bonds is GREATER than the energy released when bonds form.
(HT) When is a reaction exothermic in terms of bond energies? | When the energy needed to break bonds is LESS than the energy released when bonds form.
How can you distinguish between endothermic and exothermic reactions? | By measuring the temperature change of the surroundings - temperature increases in exothermic reactions and decreases in endothermic reactions.
