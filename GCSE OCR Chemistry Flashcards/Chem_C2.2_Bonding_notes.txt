What are metals and where are they found in the periodic table? | Metals are elements that react to form positive ions. They are found to the left and towards the bottom of the periodic table.
What are the characteristic properties of metals? | Metals are typically shiny, good electrical conductors, dense, have high melting points, and lose electrons to form positive ions.
What are non-metals and where are they found in the periodic table? | Non-metals are elements that react to form negative ions. They are found towards the right and top of the periodic table.
What are the characteristic properties of non-metals? | Non-metals are typically dull in appearance, poor electrical conductors, not dense, have low melting points, and gain electrons to form negative ions.
How are elements arranged in the periodic table? | Elements are arranged in order of atomic (proton) number and so that elements with similar properties are in columns, known as groups.
What does the group number in the periodic table represent? | The group number refers to the number of electrons in the outer shell of an atom.
What does the period number in the periodic table represent? | The period number refers to the number of shells of electrons in an atom.
Why do elements in the same group have similar chemical properties? | Elements in the same group have the same number of electrons in their outer shell, which gives them similar chemical properties.
What is ionic bonding? | Ionic bonding is the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, formed by the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal.
What are the properties of ionic compounds? | Ionic compounds have regular structures (giant ionic lattices), high melting and boiling points, and conduct electricity when melted or dissolved in water.
What is covalent bonding? | Covalent bonding occurs when atoms share pairs of electrons, resulting in an electrostatic attraction between the shared electrons and the nuclei.
What are the properties of substances with simple molecular structures? | They are usually gases or liquids with low boiling and melting points, have weak intermolecular forces between molecules, and don't conduct electricity.
Why do simple molecular substances have low melting and boiling points? | Because only the weak intermolecular forces between molecules need to be broken, not the stronger covalent bonds within molecules.
How do the melting and boiling points of simple molecules relate to their size? | The intermolecular forces increase with molecule size, so larger molecules have higher melting and boiling points.
What are the properties of substances with giant covalent structures? | They are solids with very high melting points because all atoms are linked by strong covalent bonds that must be overcome to melt or boil the substance.
What are the properties of polymers? | Polymers have very large molecules linked by strong covalent bonds, with relatively strong intermolecular forces, making them solids at room temperature.
What is metallic bonding? | Metallic bonding involves the electrostatic attraction between positive metal ions and a sea of delocalised electrons.
What properties of metals can be explained by metallic bonding? | High melting and boiling points (due to strong bonds), good conductivity of heat and electricity (due to delocalised electrons), and malleability (because layers of atoms can slide over each other).
What are the limitations of dot and cross diagrams? | They show how atoms are bonded and electrons are arranged, but don't show the 3D arrangement of molecules or intermolecular forces.
What are the limitations of ball and stick models? | They show how atoms are bonded and the 3D shape, but don't show the electrons or chemical symbols, and don't include intermolecular forces.
What is the typical arrangement of electrons in shells? | 2, 8, 8 - with the first shell holding up to 2 electrons, and the second and third shells holding up to 8 electrons each.
Why do atoms react? | Atoms react to try to achieve the most stable arrangement of electrons - typically 8 electrons in their outer shell (except the first shell which is stable with 2).
How did Mendeleev arrange elements in his early periodic table? | He ordered elements by atomic mass (with some exceptions), and left gaps for undiscovered elements with properties he predicted.
How was Mendeleev's periodic table refined into the modern periodic table? | The modern table is arranged by atomic number. Knowledge of isotopes explained why the order based on atomic weights wasn't always correct.
What happens to the electrons in the outer shell of metal atoms in a metal structure? | The electrons in the outer shell of metal atoms are delocalised and free to move through the whole structure.
What happens during the formation of an ionic bond? | Electrons in the outer shell of the metal atom are transferred to the non-metal atom, creating oppositely charged ions that are attracted to each other.
Why can metals be bent and shaped? | Because the layers of atoms in metals are able to slide over each other due to the nature of metallic bonding.
What types of substances typically conduct electricity? | Metals (due to delocalised electrons) and ionic compounds when melted or dissolved in water (due to free-moving ions).
