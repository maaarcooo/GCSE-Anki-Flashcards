What is an acid? | A substance that produces hydrogen ions (H+) in aqueous solutions with a pH between 0 and 7.
What is activation energy? | The energy required for a reaction to occur.
What is an alkali? | A substance that produces hydroxide ions (OH-) in aqueous solutions with a pH between 7 and 14.
What is an anion? | A negatively charged ion.
What is the anode? | The positive electrode where negatively charged ions lose electrons in oxidation reactions. It's where oxygen is produced (unless halide ions are present, then the halogen is produced).
What is Avogadro's constant? | The number of atoms, molecules or ions in a mole of a given substance.
What is the cathode? | The negative electrode where positively charged ions gain electrons in reduction reactions. It's where hydrogen is produced if the metal in the electrolyte is more reactive than hydrogen.
What is a cation? | A positively charged ion.
What is conservation of mass? | A law stating that no atoms are lost or made during a chemical reaction, so the mass of the products equals the mass of the reactants.
What is an electrode? | A solid conductive material through which electricity can flow, used in electrolysis to conduct electricity.
What is electrolysis? | The splitting up of an ionic compound using electricity, causing chemical reactions at the electrodes which lead to decomposition of materials.
What is an electrolyte? | A solution containing free ions from a molten or aqueous ionic substance that can move to carry charge.
What is an endothermic reaction? | A reaction that takes in energy from the surroundings, causing the temperature of the surroundings to decrease. Bond breaking is an endothermic process.
What is an exothermic reaction? | A reaction that transfers energy to the surroundings, causing the temperature of the surroundings to increase. Bond making is an exothermic process.
What does inert mean in chemistry? | Unreactive. Electrodes in electrolysis are usually chosen to be inert so they don't interfere with the reaction.
What is a limiting reactant? | The reactant that is completely used up since it limits the amount of products formed.
What is a mole? | The unit of measurement for chemical amounts. Symbol: mol.
What is neutralisation? | The reaction in which an acid and a base react to form a salt and water.
What is the overall energy change of a reaction? (Higher Tier) | The difference between the sum of energy needed to break bonds in the reactants and the sum of energy released when bonds in the products are formed.
What is oxidation? | A reaction involving the gain of oxygen. Oxidation is the loss of electrons.
What is an oxidising agent? | A species which brings about oxidation by gaining electrons. The oxidising agent is itself reduced.
What is the pH scale? | A measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution ranging from 0 to 14, measured using universal indicator or a pH probe.
What is a reaction profile? | A graph used to show the relative energies of reactants and products, the activation energy, and the overall energy change of a reaction.
What is a reducing agent? | A species which brings about reduction by losing electrons. The reducing agent is itself oxidised.
What is reduction? | A reaction involving the loss of oxygen. Reduction is the gain of electrons.
What are state symbols in chemical equations? | Symbols used to denote the states of chemicals: (s) - solid, (l) - liquid, (g) - gas, (aq) - aqueous solution.
What is a strong acid? (Higher Tier) | An acid completely ionised in aqueous solution so nearly all H+ ions are released. Examples: hydrochloric, nitric, and sulfuric acids.
What is titration? | A technique where a solution of known concentration is used to determine the concentration of an unknown solution.
What is a weak acid? (Higher Tier) | An acid only partially ionised in aqueous solution, releasing only a small number of H+ ions. Examples: ethanoic, citric, and carbonic acids.
