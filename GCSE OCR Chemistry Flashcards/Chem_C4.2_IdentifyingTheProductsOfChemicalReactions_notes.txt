How do you test for carbon dioxide gas? | Bubble the gas through limewater - it will turn milky (cloudy)
How do you test for chlorine gas? | Put damp litmus paper into the gas - the paper is bleached and turns white
How do you test for hydrogen gas? | Use a burning splint at the open end of a test tube - creates a 'squeaky pop' sound
How do you test for oxygen gas? | Insert a glowing splint into the test tube - the splint relights in oxygen
What happens when you add a few drops of NaOH to calcium ions? | White precipitate forms
What happens when you add excess NaOH to calcium ions after the initial test? | No change (precipitate remains)
What happens when you add a few drops of NaOH to copper(II) ions? | Blue precipitate forms
What happens when you add a few drops of NaOH to iron(II) ions? | Green precipitate forms
What happens when you add a few drops of NaOH to iron(III) ions? | Orange-brown precipitate forms
What happens when you add a few drops of NaOH to zinc ions? | White precipitate forms
What happens when you add excess NaOH to zinc ions after the initial test? | Precipitate re-dissolves
How do you test for carbonates? | React with dilute acids to create CO₂, then bubble through limewater - if it goes cloudy, carbonates are present
How do you test for halides (chloride, bromide, iodide)? | Add dilute nitric acid, then silver nitrate solution
What precipitate color indicates chloride ions? | White precipitate
What precipitate color indicates bromide ions? | Cream precipitate
What precipitate color indicates iodide ions? | Yellow precipitate
How do you test for sulfate ions? | Add dilute hydrochloric acid, then barium chloride solution - white precipitate forms if sulfates present
How do you perform a flame test? | Hold a sample of the metal on a spatula in a Bunsen burner flame and observe the color
What flame color does lithium produce? | Crimson
What flame color does sodium produce? | Yellow
What flame color does potassium produce? | Lilac
What flame color does copper(II) produce? | Green
What flame color does calcium produce? | Orange-red
What are the advantages of instrumental methods of analysis? | They are accurate, sensitive and rapid
What can instrumental methods detect and identify? | Elements and compounds
How do you interpret instrumental results? | Compare the given data in chart or tabular form with a reference set of data in the same form
