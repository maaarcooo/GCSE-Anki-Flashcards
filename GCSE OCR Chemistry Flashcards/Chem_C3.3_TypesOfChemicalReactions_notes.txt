What is oxidation in terms of oxygen? | Gain of oxygen
What is reduction in terms of oxygen? | Loss of oxygen
What happens when acids dissolve in water? | They release H+ ions
What happens when alkalis dissolve in water? | They release OH- ions
What is neutralization? | Acid reacting with alkali or base to form a salt plus water
What is the ionic equation for any neutralization reaction? | H+ + OH- → H2O
What general equation represents acid reacting with metal carbonate? | Acid + metal carbonate → salt + water + carbon dioxide
What general equation represents acid reacting with metal? | Acid + metal → salt + hydrogen gas
What determines the salt produced in acid reactions? | The acid used and the positive ions (metal) in the base
What salt is produced with hydrochloric acid? | Chlorides
What salt is produced with nitric acid? | Nitrates
What salt is produced with sulfuric acid? | Sulfates
What does pH measure? | Relative acidity and alkalinity
What is the pH range? | 0 to 14
What pH value is neutral? | pH 7
What pH values indicate acidity? | pH values less than 7
What pH values indicate alkalinity? | pH values greater than 7
What is OIL RIG and what does it mean? | OIL RIG stands for Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain (of electrons)
What is oxidation in terms of electrons? | Loss of electrons
What is reduction in terms of electrons? | Gain of electrons
What is a strong acid? | An acid completely ionized in aqueous solution
What is a weak acid? | An acid partially ionized in aqueous solution
Give examples of strong acids | Hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid
Give examples of weak acids | Ethanoic acid, citric acid, carbonic acid
What is the difference between strong/weak and concentrated/dilute? | Strong/weak refers to degree of ionization; concentrated/dilute refers to amount of substance in given volume
How does pH change as hydrogen ion concentration increases? | As hydrogen ion concentration increases by a factor of ten, pH decreases by one unit
How do pH values relate to acid strength? | Stronger acids have pH values closer to 0
How do pH values relate to alkali strength? | Stronger alkalis have pH values closer to 14
Name two ways to measure pH | pH meter and universal indicator
