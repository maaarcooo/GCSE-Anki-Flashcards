What are alkali metals? | The elements in Group 1 of the periodic table. They are soft and have low melting points.
What is an anion? | A negatively charged ion formed when an atom gains one or more electrons.
What is a catalyst? | A substance that increases reaction rate by providing a different pathway with lower activation energy. It is not used up in the reaction.
What is a cation? | A positively charged ion formed when an atom loses one or more electrons.
What is displacement? | A chemical reaction where a more reactive element displaces a less reactive element from its compound.
What is a flame test? (Higher Tier/Separate Sciences) | A qualitative test to identify metal ions by inserting a nichrome wire loop with the compound into a flame and observing the color.
What is a group in the periodic table? | A column of the periodic table. Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties.
What are halides? | Ions formed by halogen atoms when they gain an electron. They have a 1- charge (e.g. Cl-, Br-, I-).
What are halogens? | Elements in Group 7 of the periodic table that gain electrons to form halide ions with 1- charge.
How does reactivity change down Group 7 (halogens)? | Halogens get less reactive down the group and have higher melting and boiling points.
What are instrumental methods? (Higher Tier/Separate Sciences) | Methods used to detect and identify elements and compounds. They are accurate, sensitive and rapid.
What are noble gases? | Elements in Group 0 of the periodic table with stable full outer electron shells, making them very unreactive.
What is the periodic table? | A table of elements arranged by increasing atomic number where elements with similar properties are in the same column (group).
What is a period in the periodic table? | A row of the periodic table. Elements in the same period have the same number of electron shells.
What are transition metals? (Higher Tier/Separate Sciences) | Metals found between Groups 2 and 3 with high melting points, high density, colored compounds, and catalytic activity.
Which group contains the alkali metals? | Group 1
Which group contains the halogens? | Group 7
Which group contains the noble gases? | Group 0
What charge do halide ions have? | 1- (negative)
What happens to halogen reactivity as you go down Group 7? | It decreases
What makes noble gases unreactive? | They have stable full outer electron shells
