How do you write formulae for simple ionic compounds? | Balance the charges of the ions involved
How do you write formulae for simple covalent compounds? | Imagine what the ions would be and balance their charges (e.g., H₂O balances because H⁺ (×2) balances with O²⁻)
What is the principle of conservation of mass in chemical equations? | The same amount of each element must appear on both sides of the equation
How do you balance a chemical equation? | Count the atoms of each element on both sides and add numbers to ensure equal amounts on each side
Why do atoms form ions? | To have a stable arrangement of electrons (similar to noble gases with 8 electrons in outer shell)
In a compound, what rule must ions follow? | Their charges must balance out (e.g., H⁺ and Cl⁻ in HCl, or 2H⁺ and SO₄²⁻ in H₂SO₄)
What charges do Group 1 elements typically form as ions? | 1+ ions
What charges do Group 2 elements typically form as ions? | 2+ ions
What charges do Group 3 elements typically form as ions? | 3+ ions
What charges do Group 5 elements typically form as ions? | 3- ions
What charges do Group 6 elements typically form as ions? | 2- ions
What charges do Group 7 elements typically form as ions? | 1- ions
What ion is present in nitric acid? | NO₃⁻
What ion is present in hydrochloric acid? | Cl⁻
What ion is present in sulfuric acid? | SO₄²⁻
What do the state symbols (s), (l), (g), and (aq) represent? | (s) = solid, (l) = liquid, (g) = gas, (aq) = aqueous (dissolved in water)
What is the law of conservation of mass? | No atoms are lost or made during a chemical reaction, so the mass of products equals the mass of reactants
If a reaction shows an apparent change in mass, what might be the explanation? | A reactant or product might be a gas whose mass hasn't been accounted for
How do you construct a balanced ionic equation? | 1) Write the full chemical equation 2) Split aqueous substances into ions 3) Cancel out spectator ions (unchanged ions on both sides)
What is the Avogadro constant? | 6.02 × 10²³ per mole - the number of atoms, molecules, or ions in one mole of a substance
What is a mole? | A unit for measuring amount of substance
How is the mass of a substance related to its moles? | Mass (g) = moles × molar mass (g/mol)
How do you calculate moles from mass? | Moles = Mass (g) ÷ Molar mass (g/mol)
What is the mass of one mole of a substance in grams equal to? | Its relative formula mass (Mr)
What is stoichiometry in a chemical equation? | The balancing numbers in front of compounds/elements in reaction equations
How can you determine the stoichiometry of an equation from masses? | 1) Convert masses to moles 2) Convert moles to simple whole number ratios
What is a limiting reactant? | The reactant that is completely used up and limits the amount of product formed
How does a limiting reactant affect calculations? | You must use the moles/mass of the limiting reactant for any calculations
How do you calculate masses of reactants or products using a balanced equation? | 1) Find moles of known substance: moles = mass ÷ molar mass 2) Use balancing numbers to find moles of desired substance 3) Calculate mass: mass = moles × molar mass
If a metal reacts with oxygen, what happens to the mass? | The mass of metal oxide product is greater than the mass of metal you started with
