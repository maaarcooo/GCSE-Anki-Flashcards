# Topic 6.3: Interpreting and interacting with earth systems - Anki Flashcards

## Early Atmosphere Formation

Q: Why is evidence for early atmosphere formation limited?
A: Because of the huge time scale - 4.6 billion years ago

Q: What was the early Earth's atmosphere mainly composed of during the first billion years?
A: Mainly CO₂ with little or no O₂, similar to Mars and Venus today

Q: What caused the formation of Earth's early atmosphere?
A: Intense volcanic activity released gases

Q: What other gases did volcanoes produce besides CO₂?
A: Nitrogen (built up gradually), small amounts of methane (CH₄) and NH₃

Q: How did the oceans form?
A: Water vapour from volcanoes condensed

Q: How did CO₂ levels decrease in the early atmosphere?
A: CO₂ dissolved in water and carbonates were precipitated, forming sediments

## Oxygen-Rich Atmosphere Development

Q: How did oxygen develop in Earth's atmosphere?
A: Algae and plants produced O₂ through photosynthesis

Q: Write the word equation for photosynthesis.
A: carbon dioxide + water → glucose + oxygen (in light)

Q: Write the symbol equation for photosynthesis.
A: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

Q: When did algae first produce oxygen?
A: About 2.7 billion years ago

Q: How long did it take for oxygen levels to increase enough for animals to evolve?
A: Over the next billion years after algae appeared

## Greenhouse Effect

Q: Name three greenhouse gases.
A: Water vapour, CO₂, and CH₄ (methane)

Q: Why are greenhouse gases important?
A: They maintain temperatures on Earth high enough to support life

Q: Describe step 1 of the greenhouse effect.
A: Electromagnetic radiation from the sun passes through Earth's atmosphere

Q: Describe step 2 of the greenhouse effect.
A: Earth absorbs some radiation and warms up, then radiates heat as infrared radiation

Q: Describe step 3 of the greenhouse effect.
A: Greenhouse gases absorb some infrared radiation from Earth

Q: Describe step 4 of the greenhouse effect.
A: The atmosphere warms up, causing the greenhouse effect and global warming

## Human Causes of Climate Change

Q: What does "anthropogenic" mean?
A: Caused by human activity

Q: Give two examples of human activities that increase greenhouse gases.
A: Driving (increases CO₂) and raising livestock like cows (increases CH₄)

Q: Why is climate change modeling difficult?
A: Global climate systems are very complex to model

Q: What problems can arise from simplified climate models?
A: Speculation and biased opinions in media based on only parts of the evidence

Q: What evidence supports human-caused climate change?
A: Graphs showing correlation between atmospheric CO₂ levels and fossil fuel consumption

## Effects and Mitigation of Climate Change

Q: What causes climate change?
A: Increased levels of greenhouse gases like CO₂ and CH₄ leading to higher global temperatures

Q: Name three potential effects of climate change.
A: Species extinction, rising sea levels from melting ice caps, increased skin cancer risk from UV rays

Q: What should be considered when assessing greenhouse gas risks?
A: The scale of increased CO₂ and CH₄ levels, the risk they pose, and environmental implications

## Atmospheric Pollutants

Q: What substances are released when fuels burn completely?
A: Carbon dioxide, water vapour, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulates

Q: What happens during partial combustion?
A: Soot particles, unburnt fuel, and carbon monoxide are released due to insufficient oxygen

Q: What problems does carbon monoxide cause?
A: It's toxic and causes breathing difficulties

Q: What problems do sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides cause?
A: Acid rain

Q: What problem do solid particles cause?
A: Global dimming

## Potable Water

Q: What is potable water?
A: Water suitable for drinking with low levels of microbes and contaminants

Q: Is potable water the same as pure water?
A: No, but it's still safe to drink

Q: What are the three steps to make waste/ground water potable?
A: 1. Sedimentation (large particles sink), 2. Filtration (through sand beds), 3. Chlorination (chlorine kills microbes)

Q: How do you make seawater potable using distillation?
A: 1. Filter seawater, 2. Boil it, 3. Cool and condense the water vapour

Q: Why must water used in analysis be pure?
A: Dissolved salts could react with substances being analyzed, giving false results
