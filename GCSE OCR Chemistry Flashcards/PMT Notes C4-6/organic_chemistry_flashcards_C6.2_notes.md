# Organic Chemistry Anki Flashcards

## Naming and Functional Groups

**Q:** What are the first 4 carbon prefixes? (Use the mnemonic MEPB)
**A:** Meth- (1C), Eth- (2C), Prop- (3C), But- (4C) - "Monkeys Eat Peanut Butter"

**Q:** What suffix do alkanes have and what bonds do they contain?
**A:** -ane suffix, contain C-C and C-H bonds only

**Q:** What suffix do alkenes have and what bond makes them different?
**A:** -ene suffix, contain C=C double bonds

**Q:** What suffix do alcohols have and what functional group do they contain?
**A:** -ol suffix, contain -OH functional group

**Q:** What suffix do carboxylic acids have and what functional group do they contain?
**A:** -anoic acid suffix, contain -COOH functional group

## Reactions

**Q:** What are the products when alkanes combust completely?
**A:** Carbon dioxide and water

**Q:** What happens when alkenes react with bromine and why is this useful?
**A:** Bromine changes from orange to colorless - used as a test for C=C double bonds

**Q:** What happens when alkenes react with hydrogen?
**A:** Addition reaction occurs (hydrogen adds across the double bond)

**Q:** How can alcohols be oxidized to carboxylic acids?
**A:** Using potassium manganate(VII) with reflux - color changes from orange to green

## Addition Polymerization

**Q:** What are polymers made from?
**A:** Large molecules built up from small units called monomers

**Q:** What happens to the C=C bond during addition polymerization?
**A:** The C=C double bond is removed to form a C-C single bond

**Q:** What is a repeat unit in addition polymerization?
**A:** The monomer without the C=C double bond

**Q:** How do you find the monomer from an addition polymer?
**A:** Add a C=C double bond to the repeat unit

## Condensation Polymerization (HT)

**Q:** What is produced as a by-product in condensation polymerization?
**A:** A small molecule (often water)

**Q:** What is a diol?
**A:** A molecule with 2 alcohol (-OH) functional groups

**Q:** What is a dicarboxylic acid?
**A:** A molecule with 2 carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional groups

**Q:** What type of polymer is formed when a diol reacts with a dicarboxylic acid?
**A:** A polyester

**Q:** What small molecule is lost when diol and dicarboxylic acid react?
**A:** Water (H from alcohol + OH from carboxylic acid)

**Q:** What are the two main types of condensation polymers?
**A:** Polyesters (alcohol + carboxylic acid) and polyamides (amine + carboxylic acid)

**Q:** How do you make a polyester practically? (HT)
**A:** Heat alcohol and carboxylic acid together with an acid catalyst

## DNA and Natural Polymers

**Q:** What type of polymer is DNA?
**A:** A polymer made from four different monomers called nucleotides

**Q:** What are the four nucleotides in DNA?
**A:** Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), and Thymine (T)

**Q:** What determines the reactions of organic compounds?
**A:** The functional groups present

## Crude Oil and Fractional Distillation

**Q:** How does fractional distillation separate crude oil?
**A:** Oil is heated, evaporates, then condenses at different temperatures based on boiling points

**Q:** Where are longer chain alkanes collected in fractional distillation?
**A:** Towards the bottom due to higher boiling points and stronger intermolecular forces

**Q:** What is the general formula for alkanes found in crude oil fractions?
**A:** CₙH₂ₙ₊₂

**Q:** What is crude oil a main source of?
**A:** Hydrocarbons and feedstock for the petrochemical industry

## Uses of Crude Oil Fractions

**Q:** What is refinery gas used for?
**A:** Bottled gas for heating and cooking

**Q:** What is the gasoline fraction used for?
**A:** Fuel (petrol) for cars

**Q:** What is kerosene/paraffin used for?
**A:** Jet fuel

**Q:** What is bitumen used for?
**A:** Making roads

## Cracking

**Q:** What is the purpose of cracking hydrocarbons?
**A:** To produce smaller, more useful molecules

**Q:** What are the two methods of cracking?
**A:** 1) Pass vapors over hot catalyst (silica/alumina) 2) Mix with steam and heat to 600-700°C

**Q:** What are the products of cracking?
**A:** Alkanes and alkenes (or hydrogen)

## Fuel Cells

**Q:** What does a chemical cell produce?
**A:** A potential difference until the reactants are used up

**Q:** What is the overall reaction in a hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell?
**A:** 2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(l)

**Q:** What are the advantages of hydrogen/oxygen fuel cells?
**A:** Greater efficiency than other fuel cells, only emits water (no CO₂)

**Q:** What are the disadvantages of hydrogen/oxygen fuel cells?
**A:** Production uses finite resources, transport/storage is difficult, explosive and dangerous

**Q:** Why is crude oil considered a finite resource?
**A:** It takes millions of years to form and we're using it faster than it can be replenished
