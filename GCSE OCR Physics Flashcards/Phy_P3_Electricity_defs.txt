What is electric current? | The rate of flow of electrical charge. In metals, the flowing charges are electrons.
What is the unit of current? | Amperes (Amps)
What is charge? | A property of all matter that can be positive or negative.
What is the unit of charge? | Coulomb
What happens when like charges meet? | They repel each other.
What happens when unlike charges meet? | They attract each other.
What is potential difference? | The energy transferred per unit charge between two points in a circuit (also called voltage).
What is the unit of potential difference? | Volt (one volt equals one joule per coulomb)
What is power in electrical terms? | The rate at which an appliance transfers energy. Equals current × potential difference.
What is the unit of power? | Watt
What is resistance measured in? | Ohms
What is an ammeter? | A device connected in series with a component to measure the current flowing through it.
What is a voltmeter? | A device connected in parallel with a component to measure the potential difference across it.
What is a diode? | A component that only allows current to flow in the forward direction with very large resistance in the reverse direction.
What is a Light Emitting Diode (LED)? | A device that emits light when current flows through it, but only in one direction and requires a minimum voltage to illuminate.
What is a filament lamp? | A light-emitting component with an enclosed metal filament whose resistance increases as temperature increases.
What is a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)? | A light-sensitive component whose resistance decreases as its temperature increases.
What is a thermistor? | A temperature-dependent component whose resistance increases as temperature decreases.
What happens to components connected in series? | They have the same current passing through each component but share the total potential difference.
What happens to components connected in parallel? | They have the same potential difference across each component. Total current equals the sum of individual currents.
How do you calculate total resistance for resistors in series? | Total resistance equals the sum of the individual resistances.
How do you calculate total resistance for resistors in parallel? | The total resistance is less than the lowest individual resistance.
What is static charge? | Charge caused by an imbalance of positive and negative charges on an object's surface, often from electrons being rubbed from one surface to another.
What is earthing? | The removal of excess charge by providing a low resistance path for electrons to flow through.
What is sparking? | The transfer of electrons between surfaces with an imbalance of charges.
What causes lightning? | Static charge building up in clouds and then discharging.
What is an electric field? | A region where a charge experiences a non-contact, electric force. All charged objects have an electric field around them that is stronger closer to the charge.
What is special about the electric field between parallel plates? | It is uniform with parallel, equally spaced field lines pointing from the positive plate to the negative plate.
What happens to the electric field around a point charge as distance increases? | It becomes weaker with distance. Field lines point radially outward for positive charges and inward for negative charges.
What do electric field lines represent? | They represent the direction in which a positive charge would experience an electric force. Closer lines indicate a stronger field.
What is Ohm's Law? | The current flowing through an ohmic conductor at constant temperature is directly proportional to the potential difference across it.
What is an ohmic conductor? | A conductor whose current is directly proportional to the potential difference across it when temperature is constant.
What is direct current? | Current flow consisting of charges flowing in a single direction only, as provided by batteries and cells.
