What is the Bohr Model of the atom? | A model where negative electrons orbit a positive nucleus at set distances. It's the currently accepted model.
What are electrons? | Negatively charged particles found in different energy levels around the nucleus of an atom.
What are protons? | Positively charged particles found in the nucleus of an atom.
What are neutrons? | Neutrally charged particles found in the nucleus of an atom.
What is the nucleus? | The positively charged center of an atom containing protons and neutrons.
What was the Rutherford Model of the atom? | A model representing the atom as mostly empty space with a dense positive center and negative charges scattered around it.
What was the Thomson Model of the atom? | A rejected model that represented the atom as a ball of positive charge with negative charges distributed throughout (also called the plum-pudding model).
How do you define density? | The mass per unit volume of an object.
What is the definition of weight? | The force acting on an object due to gravity. It equals mass × gravitational field strength.
What is a fluid? | A liquid or gas.
What unit is used to measure pressure? | Pascals (Pa), equal to a force of one Newton acting perpendicular to an area of one meter squared.
What is pressure? | The force acting perpendicular to a surface, per unit area.
What is a solid? | A state of matter where particles are tightly packed, can only vibrate about fixed positions, and have strong intermolecular forces between them.
What is a liquid? | A state of matter where particles are in contact but can flow over each other, with intermolecular forces acting between them.
What is a gas? | A state of matter where particles are spread apart with high kinetic energies and very weak intermolecular forces.
What is melting? | The change from solid state to liquid state when a substance is heated.
What is freezing? | The change from liquid state to solid state when a substance is cooled.
What is evaporation? | The change from liquid state to vapor state when a substance is heated.
What is condensation? | The change from vapor state to liquid state when a substance is cooled.
What is sublimation? | The direct change of a substance from solid to vapor state without passing through the liquid phase.
What is latent heat? | The energy required for a substance to change state.
What is temperature? | A measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance. Higher temperature means higher kinetic energy and velocity.
What is specific heat capacity? | The amount of energy needed to increase the temperature of one kilogram of a substance by one degree Celsius.
What is specific latent heat? | The amount of energy needed to change the state of one kilogram of a substance while held at constant temperature.
What is specific latent heat of fusion? | The energy needed to change one kilogram of a substance from solid to liquid state at constant temperature.
What is specific latent heat of vaporization? | The energy needed to change one kilogram of a substance from liquid to vapor state at constant temperature.
How do you calculate change in thermal energy? | Mass × specific heat capacity × temperature change
What are physical changes? | Changes to the physical properties of a substance that can be reversed. Changes of state are physical changes.
What are chemical changes? | Changes to the chemical structure of a substance. The substance usually doesn't restore its original properties when the changes are reversed.
What is the atmosphere? (separate sciences) | The thin layer of air surrounding Earth, becoming less dense with increasing altitude. Pressure also decreases with increasing altitude.
What determines if an object will float? (separate sciences) | An object floats if the volume of liquid it displaces has greater weight than the object itself. The upthrust is greater than its weight.
What causes an object to sink? (separate sciences) | An object sinks if the volume of liquid it displaces has lower weight than the object itself. The upthrust is lower than its weight, creating a downward force.
What is upthrust? (separate sciences) | The upward force on an object in a fluid, occurring because it experiences greater pressure below than above. It equals the weight of fluid displaced.
How is pressure in a liquid column calculated? (separate sciences) | Pressure = height of column × density of liquid × gravitational field strength
What causes gas pressure? (separate sciences) | The perpendicular force per unit area acting on container surfaces, resulting from gas particles colliding with it.
