What does the central nervous system (CNS) consist of? | The brain and spinal cord
What are the 4 steps of how the nervous system coordinates responses? | 1) Receptors convert stimulus to electrical impulse 2) Impulse travels along sensory neurons to CNS 3) CNS processes and coordinates response 4) Motor neurons carry impulse to effectors (muscles or glands)
What is a reflex arc? | A subconscious, rapid response to dangerous stimuli, bypassing conscious brain processing
What are the 5 steps of a reflex arc? | 1) Stimulus detected by receptors 2) Impulse sent along sensory neuron 3) Impulse passes to relay neuron in CNS 4) Impulse sent along motor neuron 5) Effector produces response
What is the function of the cornea? | Transparent outer part of the eye that refracts light to reach the retina
What is the function of the iris? | Controls how much light enters the eye by changing pupil size
How does the iris respond to bright light? | Circular muscles contract and radial muscles relax to make pupil smaller

Where is adrenaline produced and what does it target? | Produced by adrenal glands on top of kidneys; targets many organs like heart and lungs
What is the 'fight or flight' response and which hormone is responsible? | Survival response that increases heart rate, dilates pupils, makes hairs stand erect, increases breathing rate; caused by adrenaline
Where is thyroxine produced and what is its function? | Produced by thyroid gland in neck; controls metabolic rate (how quickly oxygen and food react to release energy) and growth
How does negative feedback work for thyroxine? | If thyroxine levels are too low, hypothalamus produces TRH, pituitary releases TSH, thyroid produces more thyroxine; when levels return to normal, these hormones are inhibited

Which hormone is produced by ovaries and what are its functions? | Oestrogen; responsible for female secondary sexual characteristics (breast development, widening hips)
How long does the menstrual cycle last and when does ovulation typically occur? | 28 days; ovulation usually occurs on day 14
What is the role of oestrogen in the menstrual cycle? | Causes thickening of uterus lining in preparation for egg implantation; levels peak around day 10
What is the role of FSH in the menstrual cycle? | Causes maturation of egg within ovary
What is the role of LH in the menstrual cycle? | Stimulates release of egg during ovulation
What is the role of progesterone in the menstrual cycle? | Maintains thick lining of uterus; inhibits release of LH and FSH
What happens if the egg is not fertilized during the menstrual cycle? | Progesterone levels fall and uterus lining breaks down in a period lasting about 5 days
What is menopause? | When a woman no longer has a menstrual cycle, usually around ages 50-55
How do oral contraceptives (the pill) work? | Contain progesterone and oestrogen which inhibit FSH production so eggs don't mature
How do contraceptive implants work? | Slow release of progesterone to prevent egg release and thicken cervical mucus
How effective are barrier methods like condoms and what's their additional benefit? | Over 99% effective; also protect from STIs
What are the advantages and disadvantages of vasectomy/female sterilization? | Almost 100% reliable; can be irreversible
How does a copper intrauterine device (IUD) work? | Stops fertilized embryos implanting; copper kills sperm
What causes infertility? | Issues like sperm quality/quantity problems or lack of FSH to mature eggs
What fertility drugs are commonly used and how do they work? | FSH and LH, which stimulate maturation and release of eggs
What are the steps of in vitro fertilization (IVF)? | 1) Mother given FSH/LH to stimulate egg maturation 2) Eggs collected and fertilized by father's sperm in lab 3) Fertilized eggs develop into embryos 4) Embryos implanted into mother's uterus
What are tropisms in plants? | Growth responses to environmental stimuli, like light (phototropism) or gravity (gravitropism/geotropism)
What is positive phototropism and why is it beneficial? | Plant growth towards light source; beneficial as it increases photosynthesis rate
How does auxin cause shoots to bend towards light? | Auxin moves to shaded side, stimulates cell growth there, causing shoot to bend towards light
What is negative gravitropism in shoots? | Shoots grow away from gravity
How does auxin cause shoots to grow away from gravity? | In horizontal shoots, auxin moves to lower side, stimulates cell growth there, causing shoot to bend upward
What is positive gravitropism in roots? | Roots grow towards gravity
How does auxin cause roots to grow towards gravity? | In horizontal roots, auxin moves to lower side, inhibits growth there (growth occurs on upper side), causing root to bend downward
Why is positive gravitropism in roots beneficial? | Increases access to water/nutrients and provides stability for the plant
How can auxins be used as weed killers? | Synthetic auxins affect broad-leaved plants, causing cells to grow too rapidly which kills the weed
How are auxins used in rooting powders? | Applied to plant cuttings to stimulate root growth for rapid plant development
How are auxins used in tissue culture? | Added to growth medium to stimulate root and shoot formation in cloned plant cells
What is the role of gibberellins in plants? | Stimulate seed germination, flowering, and leaf shedding

How are gibberellins used to increase fruit size? | Sprayed on seedless fruits to increase their size
What is the role of ethene in plants? | Involved in cell division and fruit ripening
How is ethene used in the food industry? | Fruit picked unripe (firm for transport), then exposed to ethene and warmer temperatures to control ripening when needed
What is homeostasis? | Maintenance of constant internal environment despite internal and external changes
Why is homeostasis important? | Needed for optimal enzyme action and all cell functions
Where is the thermoregulatory center located? | In the brain
What does the thermoregulatory center monitor? | Blood temperature via brain receptors and skin temperature via skin receptors
What is the normal human body temperature? | 37.5°C
How does the body respond if temperature becomes too high? | Produces sweat (evaporation cools) and vasodilation (blood flows closer to skin surface, increasing heat loss)
How does the body respond if temperature becomes too low? | Stops sweating, shivers (muscles generate heat), hairs stand on end (traps warm air), and vasoconstriction (less blood near skin, reducing heat loss)
Why does blood glucose concentration need to be controlled? | Glucose is needed by cells for respiration
Which organ controls blood glucose levels? | The pancreas
What happens when blood glucose levels are too high? | Pancreas produces insulin which causes: 1) Glucose to move into muscle cells for respiration 2) Excess glucose converted to glycogen stored in liver
What happens when blood glucose levels are too low? | Pancreas produces glucagon which causes liver to break down glycogen into glucose, releasing it into blood
How do insulin and glucagon work together? | In a negative feedback loop - when glucose levels change, a hormone is secreted to oppose the change
What is Type 1 diabetes? | Condition where pancreas cannot produce enough insulin
How is Type 1 diabetes treated? | Insulin injections at meal times, limiting simple carbohydrates
What is Type 2 diabetes? | Condition where body cells no longer respond to insulin
What are risk factors for Type 2 diabetes? | Obesity is a major risk factor
How is Type 2 diabetes treated? | Reducing simple carbohydrates, weight loss, increasing exercise, medications to improve insulin effectiveness
What happens if blood has higher water potential than cells? | Water moves into cells causing them to expand and potentially burst (lysis)
What happens if blood has lower water potential than cells? | Water leaves cells causing them to shrink
What is the function of the kidneys? | Maintain balance of water and other substances by filtering waste and selectively reabsorbing useful substances
What are the main parts of the kidney structure? | Outer cortex, inner medulla, ureters, renal artery/vein, and millions of nephrons
What is a nephron made up of? | Glomerulus (ball of capillaries), region for selective reabsorption, and kidney tubule for water/salt regulation
What is ADH and where is it produced? | Anti-Diuretic Hormone; produced by pituitary gland
What triggers ADH release? | When brain receptors detect blood is too concentrated
How does ADH affect kidney tubules? | Increases their permeability to water, allowing more water to move back into bloodstream
What is the result of increased ADH? | Smaller volume of more concentrated (yellow) urine and less concentrated blood
How does the body respond to dehydration from sweating? | Salt loss in sweat causes kidneys to increase salt retention; brain detects this and creates thirst sensation so we drink more water
