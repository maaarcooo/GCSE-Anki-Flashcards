What are abiotic factors? | Non-living factors of an ecosystem, such as temperature, light intensity, moisture, wind, soil pH, soil minerals, and gas levels.
What are biotic factors? | Living factors of an ecosystem, such as food availability, pathogens, predators, and other species.
What is a community in ecological terms? | All of the populations of different species that are living in a habitat together.
What is an ecosystem? | The community of organisms (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components of an area and their interactions.
What is a habitat? | The place where plants, animals and other living organisms live, including all biotic and abiotic factors.
What is competition in an ecosystem? | When different organisms compete for the same resources (like food, shelter and mates) in an ecosystem, which limits population size.
What is interdependence? | The dependence of organisms on each other to survive (e.g., herbivores rely on plants, birds rely on trees for shelter).
What is a species? | A group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring.
What is a predator? | A consumer that preys on and eats other animals.
What is prey? | A consumer that is eaten by a predator.
What is predation? | A biological relationship in which a member of one species consumes a member of another species.
What is a parasite? | An organism which feeds on or in a host organism at the expense of the host.
What is parasitism? | The interaction between two organisms where only the parasite benefits while the host does not.
What is a host? | The organism on/in which a parasite lives.
What is mutualism? | The interaction between two organisms where both benefit as a result of their relationship.
What is a pathogen? | A bacteria, virus or any other microorganism that can cause disease.
What is the carbon cycle? | The cycle through which carbon moves between the environment and living organisms, involving respiration, photosynthesis, combustion and decomposition.
What is combustion? | The process by which organic matter is burnt to release energy as well as carbon dioxide and water. It is part of the carbon cycle.
What is decomposition? | The process of breaking down dead material into simple organic matter, influenced by water availability, oxygen availability and temperature.
What is a decomposer? | An organism that feeds on dead and decaying matter.
What is compost? | Dead or decaying matter that is often used as fertilizer for crops.
What is the role of microorganisms in ecosystems? | Very small organisms that recycle materials in ecosystems by converting carbon into carbon dioxide and returning mineral ions to the soil.
What is aerobic decomposition? [Higher Tier] | When organisms break down dead or decaying matter in the presence of sufficient oxygen.
What is anaerobic decomposition? [Higher Tier] | When organisms decompose matter in the absence of oxygen, producing carbon dioxide and methane gas, usually in waterlogged soils.
What is the water cycle? | The cycle of water moving between the environment and living organisms, involving precipitation, condensation, transpiration, biomass transfer and evaporation.
What is precipitation? | A part of the water cycle where water returns to land in the form of rain, snow or hail.
What is photosynthesis? | An endothermic reaction in chloroplasts that converts carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen using light energy (6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂).
What is respiration? [Higher Tier] | The process by which energy is released from glucose molecules, either aerobically (with oxygen) or anaerobically (without oxygen), releasing carbon dioxide into the air.
What is a food chain? [Higher Tier] | Shows feeding relationships between organisms and biomass transfer, following the structure: producer → primary consumer → secondary consumer → tertiary consumer.
What is a producer? [Higher Tier] | An organism that makes its own food, usually via photosynthesis.
What is a primary consumer? [Higher Tier] | A herbivore that cannot produce its own food and obtains energy by feeding on producers (trophic level two).
What is a secondary consumer? [Higher Tier] | A carnivore that cannot produce its own food and obtains energy by feeding on primary consumers (trophic level three).
What is a tertiary consumer? [Higher Tier] | A carnivore that eats other carnivores.
What is a trophic level? [Higher Tier] | The position of an organism in the food chain.
What is biomass? [Higher Tier] | The mass of all the living material present in a particular area or particular organism.
What is a pyramid of biomass? [Higher Tier] | A table showing the dry mass of living material at each trophic level in a food chain, forming the shape of a pyramid.
How is efficiency of biomass calculated? [Higher Tier] | (Biomass available after transfer / Biomass available before transfer) × 100
What is egestion? [Higher Tier] | The removal of undigested food from the body as faeces.
What is excretion? [Higher Tier] | The removal of metabolic waste from the body.
