What is magnification? | The degree to which the size of an image is larger than the real object. Magnification = image size/object size
How do you calculate the magnification of a microscope? | Magnification of microscope = magnification of the eyepiece lens × magnification of the objective lens
What is resolution in microscopy? | The ability to distinguish between 2 points that are close to each other
What are two advantages of light microscopes? | They are relatively cheap and can be used to look at living specimens
What are two disadvantages of light microscopes? | Low resolution (200nm) and low magnification strength (×1500)
What is the main difference between electron microscopes and light microscopes? | Electron microscopes use electrons instead of light, allowing scientists to view smaller subcellular structures due to electrons' smaller wavelength
What are the two types of electron microscopes? | SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) and TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope)
What is the resolution and magnification of a SEM? | 10nm resolution and ×100,000 magnification
What is the resolution and magnification of a TEM? | 0.2nm resolution and ×500,000 magnification
What are two disadvantages of electron microscopes? | They are extremely expensive and cannot look at living specimens
What is the function of the nucleus? | Contains genetic material (DNA), which codes for proteins; enclosed in a nuclear membrane
What is the function of cytoplasm? | Liquid substance where chemical reactions occur; contains enzymes and organelles
What is the function of the cell membrane? | Contains receptor molecules to identify and selectively control what enters and leaves the cell
What is the function of mitochondria? | Site of aerobic respiration reactions, providing energy for the cell
What is the function of ribosomes? | Site of protein synthesis; found on the rough endoplasmic reticulum
What is the function of chloroplasts? | Site of photosynthesis, providing food for plants; contains chlorophyll pigment
What is the function of the permanent vacuole in plant cells? | Contains cell sap, improves cell's rigidity, found within the cytoplasm
What is the function of the cell wall in plant cells? | Provides strength to the cell; made from cellulose
What structures are unique to prokaryotic cells (bacteria) compared to animal/plant cells? | Single circular strand of DNA (floating in cytoplasm) and plasmids (small rings of DNA)
What is DNA? | Deoxyribonucleic acid; a double helix made from 2 twisted strands; a polymer made of nucleotides
What are the components of a nucleotide? | One sugar molecule, one phosphate group, and one organic base (A, C, G, or T)
What is complementary base pairing in DNA? | When bases pair in specific combinations: C joins to G and A joins to T
How do nucleotides code for proteins? | Each group of three bases codes for an amino acid; these amino acids join together to make proteins
Why can't DNA leave the nucleus during protein synthesis? (Higher Tier) | DNA is too large to leave the nucleus, so its information must be copied and transported
What is transcription in protein synthesis? (Higher Tier) | The process where DNA is unzipped and mRNA nucleotides match to complementary bases on the DNA strand, creating a template strand
What is translation in protein synthesis? (Higher Tier) | The process where bases on mRNA are read in threes (triplet code) to code for specific amino acids, which are brought to ribosomes by carrier molecules
What are enzymes? | Biological catalysts (proteins) that increase reaction rates without being used up; have uniquely shaped active sites where substrates bind
How does the Lock and Key Hypothesis explain enzyme function? | The shape of the substrate is complementary to the shape of the active site, forming an enzyme-substrate complex; after the reaction, products are released
How does temperature affect enzyme activity? | Rate increases with temperature up to optimum (around 37°C), then rapidly decreases as enzymes denature (active site shape changes)
How does pH affect enzyme activity? | Most enzymes work best at pH 7; if pH is too high/low, enzyme structure changes, active site deforms, and the enzyme denatures
How does substrate concentration affect enzyme reaction rates? | Higher concentration increases reaction rate as enzymes more likely to meet substrates; levels off when all enzyme active sites are full
What is the equation for aerobic respiration? | C₆H₁₂O₆ + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O (Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water)
Where does aerobic respiration occur in cells? | Most reactions occur in the mitochondria
What is the equation for anaerobic respiration in animals? | Glucose → Lactic acid
What is the equation for anaerobic respiration in plants and yeast (fermentation)? | Glucose → Ethanol + Carbon dioxide (CO₂)
How are carbohydrates broken down in the body? | By carbohydrase enzymes (like amylase); starch → maltose
How are proteins broken down in the body? | By protease enzymes in the stomach and small intestine
How are lipids broken down in the body? | By lipase enzymes; lipids → glycerol and 3 fatty acids
What is the equation for photosynthesis? | Carbon dioxide + water → glucose + oxygen (needs light energy)
How can you calculate the rate of photosynthesis in an experiment? | By measuring the volume of oxygen produced by a plant (like pondweed) over time
How does temperature affect photosynthesis? | Rate increases with temperature up to a certain point, then decreases as enzymes denature
How does light intensity affect photosynthesis? | Higher light intensity generally increases the rate of photosynthesis
How can you prove photosynthesis requires light experimentally? | Cover half a leaf with foil, leave in light, test with iodine solution. Uncovered part turns blue-black (contains starch), covered part remains brown
What is a limiting factor in photosynthesis? | An environmental condition that restricts any increase in the rate of photosynthesis despite increases in other factors
What is the inverse square law for light intensity? (Higher Tier) | Light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source. Light intensity ∝ 1/distance²
How can farmers use knowledge of limiting factors? | To enhance conditions in greenhouses for a greater rate of photosynthesis, increasing growth and profits
What is standard form and when is it used in microscopy? (Higher Tier) | A way to write very large or small numbers (e.g., 1.5 × 10⁻⁵ = 0.000015); useful when working with microscopic measurements
What makes up bacterial cell walls compared to plant cell walls? | Bacterial cell walls are made of peptidoglycan, while plant cell walls are made of cellulose
What happens after a protein's amino acid chain is complete during protein synthesis? (Higher Tier) | The protein folds to form a unique 3D structure
