What happens when you place two like magnetic poles near each other? | They repel each other.
What happens when you place two opposite magnetic poles near each other? | They attract each other.
What are permanent magnets? | Magnets that are always magnetic and always have poles.
What are induced magnets? | Temporary magnets made from magnetic materials that don't have fixed poles.
How are induced magnets created? | By "stroking" magnetic materials with a permanent magnet, causing domains to align in the same direction.
Name three common materials that can become induced magnets. | Iron, Nickel, and Cobalt.
Which direction do magnetic field lines point? | From north pole to south pole.
How does magnetic field strength change with distance from a magnet? | It decreases as distance increases.
What indicates greater magnetic field strength when looking at field lines? | A greater concentration (closer spacing) of field lines.
What tool can be used to plot the shape of a magnetic field? | Small plotting compasses.
What is the nature of the Earth's core? | It is magnetic, with currents creating a large magnetic field around Earth.
Why does a compass point north? | It aligns itself with Earth's magnetic field lines.
Where is Earth's magnetic north pole actually located? | Over North Canada (not at the geographic North Pole).
What is unusual about Earth's magnetic poles compared to a bar magnet? | Earth's magnetic north pole is actually a magnetic south pole (and vice versa).
What is produced around a wire when current flows through it? | A magnetic field.
What rule determines the direction of a magnetic field around a current-carrying wire? | The right-hand grip rule.
How does increasing current affect the magnetic field around a wire? | The magnetic field becomes stronger.
How does increasing distance from a current-carrying wire affect the magnetic field? | The magnetic field becomes weaker.
What is a solenoid? | A coil of wire with current flowing through it, creating a magnetic field similar to a bar magnet.
Why is the magnetic field of a solenoid stronger than a straight wire? | Coiling causes the field to align and form a giant single field rather than many perpendicular fields.
How can the strength of a solenoid be increased? | By inserting an iron core in the center.
Name five factors that affect the strength of a magnetic field in a solenoid. | Size of current, length of coil, cross-sectional area, number of turns, and type of core used.
What is Fleming's Left-Hand Rule used for? | To determine the direction of force on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field.
In Fleming's Left-Hand Rule, what do the thumb, first finger, and second finger represent? | Thumb: Force direction, First finger: Field direction, Second finger: Current direction.
What is the mathematical equation for magnetic force? | F = BIL (Force = magnetic flux density × current × length)
What unit is magnetic flux density measured in? | Tesla (T).
What is magnetic flux density? | The number of magnetic flux lines per square meter.
How does an electric motor work? | A coil of current-carrying wire rotates between fixed permanent magnets as the magnetic forces on opposite sides of the coil move in opposite directions.
What happens when a magnetic field changes around a conductor? | A potential difference forms as electrons move to one side.
If a conductor experiencing a changing magnetic field is connected to a circuit, what happens? | A current will flow, producing its own magnetic field in the opposite direction to the first field.
How does an electric generator (dynamo) work? (Higher Tier) | A turbine spins a coil of wire between permanent magnets, causing the wire to cut through the magnetic field and generating a potential difference.
What type of current is produced by a basic generator? (Higher Tier) | Alternating current.
What is alternating current? (Higher Tier) | Current that constantly changes direction, causing its magnetic field to constantly change as well.
How does a transformer work? (Higher Tier) | The alternating current in the primary coil creates a changing magnetic field that cuts through the secondary coil, inducing an alternating current in the secondary coil.
Why won't a transformer work with direct current? (Higher Tier) | Direct current produces a constant magnetic field, so nothing would be induced in the secondary coil.
What is a step-up transformer? (Higher Tier) | A transformer where there are more turns on the secondary coil than the primary, increasing voltage.
What is a step-down transformer? (Higher Tier) | A transformer where there are fewer turns on the secondary coil than the primary, decreasing voltage.
What is the equation relating coil turns to potential difference in a transformer? (Higher Tier) | (Number of coils on primary ÷ Number of coils on secondary) = (pd of primary ÷ pd of secondary)
How does a dynamic microphone work? (Higher Tier) | Sound waves cause a coil of wire to move around a fixed magnet, inducing current in the coil as it cuts through the magnetic field.
How does a loudspeaker work? (Higher Tier) | Current flows into a coil around a magnet, creating a magnetic field that interacts with the magnet's field, causing the coil and attached speaker cone to move and produce sound waves.
