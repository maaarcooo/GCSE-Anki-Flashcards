What is acceleration due to gravity? | The acceleration experienced by an object in free-fall. On Earth's surface, it equals 10 m/s².
How is acceleration defined? | The rate of change of velocity. It can be calculated from the gradient of a velocity-time graph.
What are balanced forces? | A resultant force of zero.
What is centripetal force? | The resultant force that acts towards the center of the circular path of an object traveling with circular motion.
What is circular motion? | The motion of an object traveling in a circle. An object in circular motion is always accelerating due to continual direction change, requiring a centripetal force.
What is a contact force? | A force that acts on an object through physical contact.
What is displacement? | A measure of how far an object moves in a given direction. It's the straight line between starting and finishing points and is a vector quantity.
What does a distance-time graph show? | A plot of how an object's distance changes over time. The gradient of the graph at any point equals the object's speed at that point.
What is distance? | A measure of how far an object moves. It doesn't depend on direction and is a scalar quantity.
What is distortion? | The changing of an object's size or shape as a result of a deforming force.
What is elastic deformation? | A non-permanent deformation where the object returns to its original shape when the deforming forces are removed.
What is the elastic limit? | The force beyond which an object will no longer deform elastically, and will instead deform plastically.
What is an electric field? | A region where a charge will experience a non-contact electrostatic force.
What is a force field? | A region where an object will experience a non-contact force.
What are force vectors? | Arrows that represent forces. Their length represents the force's magnitude and the arrowhead shows the direction.
What is a free body diagram? | A visual representation of the forces that act on an object.
What is free-fall? | Motion under the force of gravity alone.
What is friction? | A resistive contact force that acts to oppose the relative motion between two surfaces.
What are gears? (separate sciences only) | A simple mechanism that can transmit the rotational effect of a force. They can act as force multipliers.
What is a gravitational field? | A region where a mass will experience a non-contact gravitational force. All matter produces a gravitational field, and greater mass creates a stronger field.
What is gravitational force? | A force that all matter experiences when placed in a gravitational field. This force is always attractive.
What is Hooke's Law? | The extension of a spring is directly proportional to the force applied to it, up to the limit of proportionality. The constant in this relationship is the spring constant.
What is a hydraulic lift? (separate sciences only) | A system that can act as a force multiplier by connecting two platforms with different areas by a fluid. The pressure in the fluid is the same throughout, so the platform with the smaller area experiences a greater force.
What is inertial mass? | A measure of how hard it is to change an object's velocity. It equals the ratio of force over acceleration.
What is a lever? (separate sciences only) | A simple mechanism that can transmit the rotational effect of a force. It can act as a force multiplier.
What is the limit of proportionality? | The point beyond which the extension of an elastic object is no longer directly proportional to the force applied to it.
What is a linear relationship? | A relationship between two variables where if one variable increases, so does the other by the same factor. They produce straight lines when plotted.
What is a magnetic field? | A region where a magnetic material will experience a non-contact magnetic force.
What is a moment? (separate sciences only) | The turning effect of a force, equal to the product of the force magnitude and the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of the force.
What is momentum? | The product of an object's mass and velocity.
What is Newton's First Law? | If a stationary object's resultant force is zero, it remains stationary. If a moving object's resultant force is zero, it continues moving at constant velocity.
What is Newton's Second Law? | An object's acceleration is directly proportional to the resultant force acting on it, and inversely proportional to the object's mass.
What is Newton's Third Law? | The forces that two objects exert on each other when they interact are equal and opposite.
What is a non-contact force? | A force that acts on an object at a distance. There is no physical contact, and the force acts through a field.
What is a pivot? (separate sciences only) | The point around which something rotates.
What is plastic deformation? | A permanent deformation where the object will no longer return to its original shape when the deforming forces are removed.
What is power? | The rate at which energy is transferred, or the rate at which work is done. It is calculated by dividing the work done by the time taken.
What is the principle of moments? (separate sciences only) | For an object in equilibrium, the sum of the clockwise moments about any point must equal the anticlockwise moments about that same point.
What is resultant force? | The single force that can replace all the individual forces acting on an object and have the same effect.
What is resultant moment? (separate sciences only) | The single moment that has the same effect as the sum of all the other clockwise and anticlockwise moments acting on an object.
What are scalar quantities? | Quantities that only have a magnitude, not a direction.
What is speed? | A scalar quantity measuring the rate of change of distance. Average speed is calculated by dividing distance traveled by time taken.
What is the spring constant? | A measure of a spring's stiffness. The higher the spring constant, the smaller the extension for a given force.
What are vector quantities? | Quantities that have both magnitude and direction. They are represented by arrows, with length showing magnitude and arrowhead showing direction.
What does a velocity-time graph show? | A plot of how an object's velocity changes over time. The gradient equals acceleration at that point. The area under the graph equals displacement.
What is velocity? | A vector quantity measuring the rate of change of displacement. It is speed in a given direction.
What is weight? | The force acting on an object due to gravity. It equals the product of the object's mass and the gravitational field strength at its location.
