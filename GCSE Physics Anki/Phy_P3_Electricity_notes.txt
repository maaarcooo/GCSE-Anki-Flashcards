What is charge? | A property of all matter that can be positive or negative. If a body has equal amounts of positive and negative charge, they cancel out to form a neutral body.
How do like and opposite charges interact? | Like charges repel and opposite charges attract.
What's the difference between insulators and conductors? | Insulators don't conduct charge as their charged particles are fixed and cannot flow throughout the material. Conductors can conduct charge as their charged particles are delocalised and can flow.
What happens when two insulators are rubbed together? | Electrons are transferred from one insulator to the other, creating a positive charge on the object losing electrons and a negative charge on the object gaining electrons.
Why do conductors typically remain neutral when rubbed? | If conductors are rubbed, electrons will flow in and out of them, cancelling any overall effect.
What causes sparking between charged objects? | Sparking occurs when enough charge builds up and the objects are close but not touching. The "spark" is charge jumping through air from a highly negative object to a highly positive object to balance the charges.
What is electrostatic force? | The force exerted between charged objects that can be attractive or repulsive. It's a non-contact force as it's experienced even when objects aren't touching.
How does the electrostatic force change with distance? | Greater charge and smaller separations result in greater force, as the force is proportional to the inverse square of the distance.
Why do charged objects attract small neutral objects? | The positive/negative charge on the object attracts/repels electrons within the small objects, inducing a charge inside them and causing attraction.
What are electric fields? (Physics Only - Higher Tier) | Fields that surround electric charges, pointing in the direction a positive charge would move (away from positive charges and towards negative charges). Fields point at right angles to the surface.
What determines the strength of an electric field? (Physics Only - Higher Tier) | The stronger the charge, the more field lines there are and the stronger the force felt.
What two things are needed for a current to flow? | A closed circuit and a source of potential difference (e.g., a battery).
What is the relationship between charge, current and time? | Charge = Current × Time
What is potential difference (p.d.)? | The energy transferred per unit charge, measured in Volts (V).
How is potential difference measured in a circuit? | Using a voltmeter placed in parallel across a component.
What is current and how is it measured? | Current is the rate of flow of charge (electrons), measured in Amps (A) using an ammeter placed in series.
What's the difference between series and parallel circuits? | In a series circuit, current follows a single path and is the same everywhere. In a parallel circuit, current splits into multiple paths and may differ in different branches.
What is the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance? | Voltage = Current × Resistance
What happens to the resistance of a wire as current increases? | Resistance increases because electrons have more energy and transfer it to atoms in the resistor, causing increased vibrations that make it harder for electrons to flow.
How does a thermistor's resistance change with temperature? | For thermistors, resistance is lower at higher temperatures.
How does resistance change with wire length? | Greater length means more resistance and lower current, as electrons must travel through more resistor atoms.
How does resistance change with cross-sectional area? | Thinner wires give greater resistance because there's less room for electrons to pass through between atoms.
How does an LDR's resistance change with light? | Greater intensity of light results in lower resistance. Resistance is greatest when dark.
How do diodes affect current flow? | Diodes allow current to flow freely in one direction but have very high resistance in the opposite direction.
What relationship is shown by a linear graph of current against voltage? | If resistance (R) is constant, the graph of current (I) against voltage (V) is linear.
What does a non-linear I-V graph indicate? | If the graph of current against voltage is non-linear, it indicates that resistance is changing.
What is important to remember when conducting electrical experiments? | Components should not overheat - always leave them to cool down between readings.
How do you calculate the total resistance of resistors in series? | The total resistance is the sum of the resistance in each component.
How do you calculate the total resistance of resistors in parallel? | Total resistance is less than the branch with the smallest resistance and is calculated as the sum of the reciprocals of resistance.
Why is the total resistance of two resistors in parallel smaller than just one? | Because charge has more than one branch to take, so only some charge will flow along each branch.
What is the formula for power in terms of current and voltage? | Power = Current × Voltage
What is the formula for power in terms of current and resistance? | Power = Current² × Resistance
What is the formula for energy in terms of charge and potential difference? | Energy = Charge × Potential Difference
What is the formula for energy in terms of power and time? | Energy = Power × Time = Current × Voltage × Time
