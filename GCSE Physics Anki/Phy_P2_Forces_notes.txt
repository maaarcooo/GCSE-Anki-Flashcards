What is the formula for speed? | Speed = distance ÷ time
What is the difference between a vector and a scalar? | A vector has magnitude and direction, whereas a scalar has just magnitude
What does a negative gradient on a distance-time graph indicate? | The object is returning back to the starting point
What does a horizontal line on a distance-time graph indicate? | The object is stationary
What does the gradient of a distance-time graph show? | Velocity
What does the gradient of a velocity-time graph show? | Acceleration
What does the area under a velocity-time graph represent? | The total distance traveled
What is the formula for average speed? | Average speed = total distance ÷ total time
What is electrostatic interaction? | A force of attraction or repulsion that occurs between charged particles
What is gravitational attraction? | A force that occurs between particles with mass
What are contact forces? | Forces experienced in the opposite direction to contact, such as friction
In which direction does the reaction force act? | Normal (perpendicular) to the line of contact, from the point of contact
In which direction does friction act? | In the opposite direction to movement, along the line of contact
In which direction does weight always act? | Vertically downwards, from the object's center of mass
What does a larger arrow in a free body force diagram represent? | A greater force
What is Newton's First Law? | An object has a constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force
What is acceleration? | Change in velocity over time
What is Newton's Second Law? | Force = mass × acceleration
What is inertia? | The measure of how difficult it is to change the velocity of an object depending on its mass
How is inertia calculated? | Mass = force ÷ acceleration
What is momentum and how is it calculated? | Momentum = mass × velocity (units N·s or kg·m/s)
What is conserved in an elastic collision? | Momentum and kinetic energy
What is Newton's Third Law? | Every action force has an equal and opposite reaction force
What is the formula for work done? | Work done = force × distance (along the line of action of the force)
What is the unit for work done? | Joules
What conditions are needed to stretch an object? | It must be pulled in opposite directions or fixed at one point and pulled from another
What is elastic deformation? | When an object returns to its original shape after the load is removed
What is plastic deformation? | When an object does not return to its original shape after the load is removed
What is Hooke's Law? | F = kx (where F is force, k is spring constant, x is extension)
What does the gradient of a linear Force-Extension graph represent? | The spring constant (k)
What is the elastic limit? | The point at which a material stops following Hooke's Law
What characterizes a brittle material on a force-extension graph? | A linear graph with no non-linear end section (it snaps rather than stretches after the elastic limit)
How do you calculate work done on a spring? | Work Done = ½kx² (area under the force-extension graph)
What is weight? | The force exerted on a mass by the gravitational field
How is weight calculated? | Weight = mass × gravitational field strength = m × g
What is the unit for weight? | Newtons
Why would your weight be different on different planets but your mass stays the same? | Different planets have different gravitational field strengths (g)
What is gravitational potential energy and how is it calculated? | Energy from height in a gravitational field; GPE = mgh (mass × field strength × height)
What is a moment of force? | Force × perpendicular distance (from pivot)
When is an object in equilibrium regarding moments? | When sum of anticlockwise moments = sum of clockwise moments
How do gears change speed and force? | A lower gear (fewer teeth) turns faster with less force; a higher gear (more teeth) turns slower with more force
How is pressure calculated? | Pressure = force (normal to surface) ÷ area
Why does a hydraulic brake system multiply force? | Pressure is constant in fluids, so a wider cylinder creates greater force to maintain the same pressure
