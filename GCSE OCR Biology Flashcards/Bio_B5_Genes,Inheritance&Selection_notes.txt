What is a gamete? | An organism's reproductive cell (egg in females and sperm in males), which has half the number of chromosomes (23).
What is a chromosome? | A structure found in the nucleus which is made up of a long strand of DNA.
What is a gene? | A short section of DNA that codes for a protein, and therefore contributes to a characteristic.
What is an allele? | The different forms of a gene - humans have two alleles for each gene as they inherit one from each parent.
What is a dominant allele? | Only one (out of the two alleles) is needed for it to be expressed and for the corresponding phenotype to be observed.
What is a recessive allele? | Two copies are needed for it to be expressed and for the corresponding phenotype to be observed.
What does homozygous mean? | When both inherited alleles are the same (i.e., two dominant alleles or two recessive alleles).
What does heterozygous mean? | When one of the inherited alleles is dominant and the other is recessive.
What is a genotype? | The combination of alleles an individual has, e.g., Aa
What is a phenotype? | The physical characteristics that are observed in the individual, e.g., eye color
What is the genome? | All the genetic information of an organism.
How does mutation affect non-coding DNA? (Higher Tier) | If the mutation is in a non-coding region of DNA, it can still affect how genes are expressed by stopping transcription of mRNA in the protein synthesis process.
How does mutation affect coding DNA? (Higher Tier) | If the mutation occurs in a coding region of DNA, it can alter the activity of the protein that the altered area of DNA is meant to code for, such as by changing protein structure.
What are the steps of protein synthesis? (Higher Tier) | 1. DNA strands separate 2. mRNA nucleotides match to complementary bases 3. mRNA strand forms 4. mRNA moves to ribosomes 5. Bases read in threes to code for amino acids 6. Amino acids brought to ribosomes 7. Amino acids connect to form protein 8. Protein folds into 3D structure
What are two advantages of sexual reproduction? | 1. Produces variation in offspring which helps species survive environmental changes 2. Allows for selective breeding to produce offspring with desirable characteristics
What are two advantages of asexual reproduction? | 1. Only one parent is needed 2. Uses less energy and is faster as organisms don't need to find a mate
What is meiosis? | The formation of four non-identical cells (gametes) from one cell, where each gamete has half the number of chromosomes.
How many chromosomes do human gametes have? | 23 chromosomes (haploid)
What is the purpose of a Punnett square diagram? | To predict the probability of offspring having certain genotypes and phenotypes based on the parents' alleles.
How are sex chromosomes different from other chromosomes? | The 23rd pair carries sex-determining genes, and the two chromosomes can look different (Y chromosomes are much smaller than X chromosomes).
How is a baby's sex determined? | Males provide either X or Y chromosomes in sperm, while females only provide X chromosomes in eggs. XY results in a male baby, XX results in a female baby.
What were Mendel's main conclusions from his pea plant experiments? (Higher Tier) | 1. Offspring inherit 'hereditary units' from parents 2. One unit is received from each parent 3. Units can be dominant or recessive and cannot be mixed together
What is evolution? | A change in the inherited characteristics of a population over time through natural selection, which may result in the formation of a new species.
What are the steps of natural selection? | 1. Mutations provide variation 2. Advantageous mutations help survival 3. Organisms with advantages reproduce and pass on mutations 4. Over generations, the frequency of the mutation increases in the population
What is speciation? | When one population of a species becomes so different that they can no longer interbreed to produce fertile offspring, creating a new species.
What is the difference between artificial and natural classification? | Artificial classification (Linnaeus) is based on observations and human judgment, while natural classification uses molecular techniques like DNA sequencing to determine relationships.
What are the three domains in current classification systems? | 1. Archaea (primitive bacteria in extreme environments) 2. Bacteria (true bacteria) 3. Eukaryota (organisms with a nucleus)
What is the binomial system? | A naming system that gives each organism a two-part name used worldwide - the first part is genus, the second is species (e.g., Harmonia axyridis for ladybug).
How are fossils formed? | 1. Parts don't decay due to lack of oxygen/moisture 2. Parts are replaced by minerals as they decay 3. Traces like footprints remain as ground hardens around them
How does antibiotic resistance develop in bacteria? | 1. Some bacteria have genes for antibiotic resistance 2. Exposure to antibiotics kills non-resistant bacteria 3. Resistant bacteria survive and reproduce 4. The resistant genes spread through the population
What were Darwin's key ideas about evolution? (Higher Tier) | 1. Variation exists within species due to mutations 2. Organisms with characteristics best suited to environment survive longer ("survival of the fittest") 3. Beneficial characteristics pass to next generations 4. Over time, advantageous alleles increase in frequency
Why was Darwin's theory controversial? (Higher Tier) | 1. It contradicted the idea of God as creator 2. There was limited evidence at the time 3. The mechanisms of inheritance and variation were unknown
What is Wallace's process of speciation? (Higher Tier) | 1. Variation exists in populations 2. Advantageous alleles are selected for 3. Populations become isolated 4. Different alleles become advantageous in new environments 5. Genetic variation increases between populations 6. Eventually they can't interbreed, forming new species
