What is diffusion? | The spreading out of particles resulting in net movement from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. It is passive (no energy required).
Which molecules can move by diffusion across cell membranes? | Small molecules like oxygen, glucose, amino acids and water. Larger molecules like starch and proteins cannot.
Why can single-celled organisms rely on diffusion alone for transport? | They have a relatively large surface area to volume ratio and low metabolic demands.
What are three factors that affect the rate of diffusion? | 1) Concentration gradient (greater difference = faster rate) 2) Temperature (higher temperature = faster rate) 3) Surface area of membrane (larger area = faster rate)
What is osmosis? | The movement of water from a less concentrated solution to a more concentrated one through a partially permeable membrane. It is a passive process.
What happens to an animal cell in a hypotonic solution (lower concentration outside)? | Water moves into the cell causing it to swell and potentially burst.
What happens to a plant cell in a hypertonic solution (higher concentration outside)? | Water moves out of the cell causing it to become soft and eventually plasmolysis occurs (cell membrane pulls away from cell wall).
What is turgor pressure in plants? | The pressure caused by water moving into cells by osmosis, essential for keeping leaves and stems rigid.
What is active transport? | The movement of particles from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration (against the concentration gradient). It requires energy from respiration.
Give two examples of active transport in living organisms. | 1) Root hair cells taking up mineral ions from soil 2) Absorption of glucose and amino acids from gut into bloodstream
What is mitosis? | A type of cell division where one cell divides to form two identical daughter cells.
What happens during interphase (stage 1 of the cell cycle)? | The cell grows, organelles increase in number, proteins are synthesized, chromosomes are replicated, and energy stores increase.
What happens during mitosis stage (stage 2 of the cell cycle)? | Chromosomes line up at the equator of the cell and spindle fibers pull each chromosome to opposite sides of the cell.
What happens during cytokinesis (stage 3 of the cell cycle)? | Two identical daughter cells form when the cytoplasm and cell membranes divide, each containing the same 46 chromosomes as the original cell.
What is the importance of mitosis in multicellular organisms? | It's important for growth, development, replacing damaged cells, and asexual reproduction.
What is cell differentiation? | The process where cells gain new sub-cellular structures to become specialized for specific roles.
What are stem cells? | Undifferentiated cells that can divide to produce many more similar cells, some of which can differentiate into different cell types.
How do sperm cells show specialization? | Streamlined head and long tail for swimming, many mitochondria for energy, and acrosome with digestive enzymes to break down egg cell membrane.
How do nerve cells show specialization? | Long axon to carry impulses over long distances, many dendrites to form connections with other cells, and nerve endings with mitochondria to produce neurotransmitters.
How do muscle cells show specialization? | Special proteins (actin and myosin) for contraction, lots of mitochondria for energy, and ability to store glycogen for respiration.
How do root hair cells show specialization? | Large surface area from root hairs, large permanent vacuole affecting water movement, and mitochondria for active transport of minerals.
How do xylem cells show specialization? | Lignin deposition causing cell death and hollow tubes, joined end-to-end for water transport, and spiral lignin reinforcement to withstand pressure.
How do phloem cells show specialization? | Cell walls form sieve plates allowing movement between cells, and companion cells provide energy through their mitochondria.
What are the characteristics of embryonic stem cells? | They form when egg and sperm fuse, can differentiate into any type of body cell, and can be cultured in labs.
What are the characteristics of adult stem cells? | Found in bone marrow, can form many types of cells (but not any type), including blood cells.
What are meristems in plants? | Stem cells found in root and shoot tips that can differentiate into any type of plant cell throughout the plant's life.
How can plant meristems be useful? | They can be used to make clones with desirable features (like disease resistance), for research, or to save rare plants from extinction.
What is surface area to volume ratio? | The size of the surface area of an organism compared to its volume. It's calculated as surface area:volume in lowest whole numbers.
Why is surface area to volume ratio important for organisms? | If it's large, the organism is less likely to need specialized exchange surfaces or transport systems because diffusion alone is sufficient.
How do lungs maximize gas exchange? | Alveoli create a large surface area, have thin walls for short diffusion pathways, and efficient blood supply maintains a steep concentration gradient.
How does the small intestine maximize absorption? | Villi increase surface area and have a single layer of cells creating a thin membrane for absorption.
How do leaves maximize gas exchange? | Flattened shape and internal air spaces increase surface area for carbon dioxide to enter cells.
What is a double circulatory system? | A system with two circuits: one circuit pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs, and the other pumps oxygenated blood around the body.
Why do mammals need a double circulatory system? | Because their higher metabolic rate requires a faster system to deliver oxygen and nutrients.
What are the four chambers of the heart? | Right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, and left ventricle.
Why is the left ventricle wall thicker than the right ventricle wall? | Because it needs to pump blood all around the body (high pressure), while the right ventricle only pumps to the lungs (lower pressure).
What is the function of heart valves? | To ensure blood flows in one direction and does not flow backwards.
How are arteries adapted for their function? | Layers of muscle make them strong, and elastic fibers allow them to stretch to withstand high pressure.
How are veins adapted for their function? | Wide lumen allows low pressure blood to flow, and valves ensure blood flows in the right direction.
How are capillaries adapted for their function? | One cell thick walls create a short diffusion pathway, and permeable walls allow substances to move across.
How are red blood cells adapted for their function? | Contain hemoglobin to transport oxygen, no nucleus for more space, biconcave shape for maximum surface area, and flexible to fit through narrow vessels.
What is plasma and what does it transport? | Plasma is the liquid part of blood made mostly of water. It transports blood cells, platelets, amino acids, carbon dioxide, urea, and other water-soluble substances.
What is transpiration? | The loss of water vapor from leaves and stems of a plant, occurring as a consequence of gaseous exchange.
How does the transpiration stream work? | As water evaporates from leaves, more water is pulled up through the xylem due to water molecules being attracted to each other, creating a continuous stream.
How are xylem vessels adapted for their function? | Lignin deposition makes them hollow tubes, they join end-to-end to form a continuous pathway, and lignin strengthens them to withstand water pressure.
How do root hair cells help with water uptake? | They have a large surface area to absorb water via osmosis from the soil.
How do guard cells control water loss? | They are kidney-shaped with thin outer walls and thick inner walls, changing shape when full of water to open stomata. They are also light sensitive.
Why are more stomata found on the lower surface of leaves? | To minimize water loss as the lower surface is shaded and cooler, while still allowing gas exchange.
How does increased light intensity affect transpiration rate? | It increases photosynthesis, causing more stomata to open for gas exchange, which increases water evaporation and transpiration rate.
How does increased temperature affect transpiration rate? | Molecules move faster, increasing evaporation and photosynthesis rate, which opens more stomata and increases transpiration.
How does increased air movement (wind) affect transpiration rate? | It removes water vapor from around the leaf, creating a steeper concentration gradient that increases diffusion and transpiration rate.
How does increased humidity affect transpiration rate? | Higher humidity reduces the concentration gradient between inside and outside the leaf, decreasing diffusion and transpiration rate.
What is a potometer used for? | To investigate how environmental factors affect water uptake and transpiration rate in plants.
What is translocation? | The movement of food substances (made in leaves) up or down the phloem for immediate use or storage.
How are phloem cells adapted for their function? | Elongated cells with sieve plates (holes in cell walls), few organelles to allow cell sap movement, and companion cells with mitochondria to provide energy.
What is the difference between transpiration and translocation? | Transpiration is the loss of water vapor from leaves, while translocation is the movement of food substances through the phloem.
