What is biodiversity? | The variety of different species of organisms on Earth or within an ecosystem.
Why is high biodiversity important for an ecosystem? | It makes the ecosystem more stable, as species would be less dependent on each other for food and shelter.
What is a quadrat used for in ecology? | To estimate distribution and abundance of organisms within a large area by looking at smaller representative samples.
What is a transect? | A defined area where samples are taken to estimate the number of organisms across a whole area.
How can the accuracy of quadrat estimations be improved? | By doing more samples, repeat testing, or completing sampling over larger transects.
What are nets used for in ecological sampling? | For collecting flying insects like butterflies by sweeping through long grass.
What is a pooter and how is it used? | A small jar used to collect small animals. One tube goes over the insect and you suck into the other tube to apply suction (with mesh covering to prevent swallowing insects).
What are pitfall traps used for? | To sample small insects like beetles or spiders by burying a container in the ground.
What is the capture-recapture method? | A method where insects that fall into a trap are marked harmlessly, released, and then the trap is set up again later to calculate population size based on marked individuals recaptured.
What assumptions must be made when using the capture-recapture method? | No death or movement of animals between samples and that markings don't affect survival rate.
How does deforestation contribute to global warming? | Trees contain carbon, so burning them releases CO₂. Decomposing vegetation produces CO₂ as microorganisms respire. Fewer trees means less CO₂ is absorbed through photosynthesis.

What is the difference between communicable and non-communicable diseases? | Communicable diseases can spread between people (caused by pathogens), while non-communicable diseases can't spread (often caused by lifestyle factors).
How do HIV and TB interact? | HIV weakens the immune system, making patients more susceptible to TB infections.
How do HPV and cervical cancer interact? | Viruses living in cells can trigger cancers; most cervical cancer cases are linked with HPV virus.
How do viruses replicate? | They infect host cells, replicate their DNA many times, then burst to release new viruses that infect nearby cells.
Why can't viral infections be treated with antibiotics? | Viruses live inside host cells, so drugs that would kill them would also damage body tissue.
What is HIV and how is it spread? | Human Immunodeficiency Virus; spread through bodily fluids, commonly through sexual activities or sharing drug needles.
What is TMV and how does it affect plants? | Tobacco Mosaic Virus; infects chloroplasts of leaves changing green to white spots in a mosaic pattern, preventing photosynthesis.
What are the symptoms of Salmonella? | Fever, stomach cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea.
How is Salmonella prevented? | Keeping raw meat away from cooked food, not washing raw meat, washing hands and surfaces, cooking food thoroughly.
What is crown gall disease and what causes it? | A plant disease caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens which transfers some of its DNA to the infected plant's DNA.
What is malaria and how is it spread? | A disease caused by a protist that enters red blood cells; spread by female Anopheles mosquito when it feeds on blood.
How can malaria be prevented? | Using insecticide-coated nets while sleeping, removing stagnant water to prevent mosquito breeding, and taking antimalarial drugs when traveling.
Name two physical defenses in plants. (Higher tier) | Bark (external layer of dead cells), cell wall (made of cellulose), and leaf cuticle (waxy outer layer).
Name two chemical defenses in plants. (Higher tier) | Antimicrobial substances (like mint and witch hazel) and poisons (like those in stinging nettles).
What is ELISA and what is it used for? (Higher tier) | Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; used to detect whether a plant contains a pathogen antigen and is therefore infected.
What is PCR and what is it used for? (Higher tier) | Polymerase Chain Reaction; allows a small section of DNA to be copied billions of times to detect plant diseases.
Name five non-specific defense systems in humans. | Skin (physical barrier), nose (hairs/mucus), trachea/bronchi (mucus/cilia), stomach (acid), and phagocytic white blood cells.
What is phagocytosis? | A process where white blood cells engulf and kill pathogens.
How do antibodies work? | They bind to antigens on pathogen surfaces, causing pathogens to clump together making it easier for white blood cells to find them.
What happens when you get infected with the same pathogen a second time? | The specific complementary antibodies are produced faster, so you don't feel symptoms - you are immune.
What are monoclonal antibodies? (Higher tier) | Identical antibodies produced from the same lymphocyte that bind to only one protein antigen.
How are monoclonal antibodies produced? (Higher tier) | 1) Inject antigen into mouse 2) Mouse produces lymphocytes with specific antibodies 3) Remove spleen cells 4) Combine with myeloma cells to form hybridoma 5) Hybridoma divides to produce clones 6) Collect and purify antibodies.
How do pregnancy tests use monoclonal antibodies? (Higher tier) | They detect hCG hormone in urine using antibodies attached to blue beads that bind to stationary antibodies, creating a blue line if pregnant.
How can monoclonal antibodies be used to treat cancer? (Higher tier) | Toxic drugs can be attached to antibodies to deliver them directly to cancer cells, or they can encourage white blood cells to attack cancer cells.
What is a vaccine and how does it work? | Contains dead/inactive pathogen to stimulate white blood cells to produce antibodies without causing illness, so body can respond quickly to real infection.
What is herd immunity? | When a large proportion of the population is immune, reducing the spread of the pathogen as there are fewer people to catch the disease from.
Why can't antibiotics kill viruses? | Viruses use body cells to reproduce, so drugs targeting them would also affect body tissue.
