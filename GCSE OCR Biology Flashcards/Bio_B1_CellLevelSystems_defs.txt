What is the active site of an enzyme? | The part of the enzyme which is specific to the substrate and has a complementary shape to it.
What is the equation for aerobic respiration? | Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon Dioxide + Water
What are amino acids? | Small molecules that make up a protein.
What does amylase do? | An enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates into simple sugars. It is produced in the pancreas and salivary glands.
What is the equation for anaerobic respiration in animals? | Glucose → Lactic Acid
What is a carbohydrate? | A large molecule that is synthesised from simple sugars.
What is the cell membrane? | A selectively permeable barrier which controls the movement of substances into and out of the cell. It also has receptor molecules on the surface for cell-to-cell signalling.
What is cellular respiration? | A continuously occurring chemical process in all living cells that releases energy (ATP) from the breakdown of organic compounds like glucose.
What is the cell wall made of and what's its function? | An outer layer made of cellulose fibres that provides the plant cell with strength and support.
What are chloroplasts? | The organelles that are the site of photosynthesis. They contain chlorophyll which absorbs light energy and enzymes needed for photosynthesis.
What is a chromosome? | A long, coiled molecule of DNA that carries genetic information in the form of genes.
What is a cover slip? | A small piece of glass placed on top of the specimen to protect it from the lens.
What is denaturation? | The permanent change in the shape of an enzyme's active site that stops the enzyme functioning normally.
What is DNA? | A polymer made up of four nucleotides, each consisting of a phosphate group and a sugar with one of four bases attached: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C) and Guanine (G).
What are enzymes? | Biological catalysts that increase the rate of chemical reactions.
What is enzyme specificity? | Enzymes will only act on specific substrates that have a complementary shape to the active site of the enzyme.
What is a eukaryotic cell? | A type of cell found in plants and animals that has a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.
What is an exothermic reaction? | A reaction that releases energy, usually in the form of light or heat.
What is the eyepiece lens? | The lens that further magnifies the image produced by the objective lens.
What is a fatty acid? | A carboxylic acid that has a long carbon chain. Fatty acids react with glycerol to make lipids.
What is genetic material? | The material that stores the genetic information.
What is a light microscope? | A microscope that uses light to produce an image of a specimen.
What is a limiting factor? | A factor that when in short or inadequate supply limits the rate of a reaction.
What does lipase do? | An enzyme that breaks down lipids into fatty acids and glycerol.
What is a lipid? | A large molecule that is synthesised from three fatty acids and a glycerol molecule.
What is the lock and key hypothesis? | A theory that describes how substrates must be the correct shape to fit the active site of an enzyme.
How do you calculate magnification? | Magnification = image size / actual size
What are mitochondria? | The organelle which is the site of aerobic respiration. It contains enzymes required for cellular respiration.
What is a monomer? | A small molecule which can be bonded to other identical monomers to form a large polymer. Monomers usually contain a carbon-carbon double bond, C=C.
What is a nucleotide? | The monomers of DNA that consist of a common sugar, a phosphate group and a base attached to the sugar. The chemical base can be one of A, C, T or G.
What is the nucleus? | An organelle found in most eukaryotic cells that contains the cell's genetic material and controls the activities of the cell.
What is the objective lens? | The lens found closest to the specimen that magnifies the image.
What is palisade mesophyll? | A specialised plant tissue that carries out photosynthesis.
What is a permanent vacuole? | An organelle found in plant cells which stores cell sap and helps maintain the cell's turgidity.
What is photosynthesis and its equation? | An endothermic reaction in chloroplasts converting carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen using light energy. 6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ (using sunlight energy)
What are photosynthetic organisms? | Organisms that are the main producers of food and therefore biomass for life on earth.
What is a plasmid? | A circular loop of double-stranded DNA found in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells, free to move unlike chromosomal DNA.
What is a polymer? | Many small molecules (monomers) chemically joined together to make 1 large molecule.
What is a prokaryotic cell? | A unicellular organism that lacks a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles e.g. bacteria.
What is a protein? | A large molecule synthesised from amino acid monomers.
What is protein synthesis? | The formation of proteins from amino acids which takes place in the ribosomes.
What is resolution in microscopy? | The ability to see two cells as two separate entities (measured in dpi).
What are ribosomes? | Organelles which are the site of protein synthesis.
What is a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)? | A microscope that uses reflected electrons to produce a 3D image of a specimen with lower resolution.
What is a slide? | A thin piece of glass on which the specimen is placed.
What is transcription? | The unzipping of the DNA molecule around the gene, copying it to mRNA in the nucleus.
What is translation? | Translating the mRNA sequence to an amino acid sequence during protein synthesis.
What is a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)? | A microscope that uses transmitted electrons to produce a 2D image of a specimen with higher resolution, showing details of organelles.
What is xylem? | A specialised plant tissue that transports water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the leaves of the plant.
What happens during cellular respiration? | Energy is released from glucose through chemical reactions, producing ATP that cells can use.
How do temporary vacuoles in animal cells differ from permanent vacuoles in plant cells? | Animal cells have small temporary vacuoles used for storage and transportation, while plant cells have large permanent vacuoles that store cell sap and maintain turgidity.
What are the two main types of microscopes that use electrons? | Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) which produces 3D images with lower resolution, and Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) which produces 2D images with higher resolution.
