Why is evidence for early atmosphere formation limited? | Because of the huge time scale - 4.6 billion years ago
What was the early Earth's atmosphere mainly composed of during the first billion years? | Mainly CO₂ with little or no O₂, similar to Mars and Venus today
What caused the formation of Earth's early atmosphere? | Intense volcanic activity released gases
What other gases did volcanoes produce besides CO₂? | Nitrogen (built up gradually), small amounts of methane (CH₄) and NH₃
How did the oceans form? | Water vapour from volcanoes condensed
How did CO₂ levels decrease in the early atmosphere? | CO₂ dissolved in water and carbonates were precipitated, forming sediments
How did oxygen develop in Earth's atmosphere? | Algae and plants produced O₂ through photosynthesis
Write the word equation for photosynthesis. | carbon dioxide + water → glucose + oxygen (in light)
Write the symbol equation for photosynthesis. | 6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂
When did algae first produce oxygen? | About 2.7 billion years ago
How long did it take for oxygen levels to increase enough for animals to evolve? | Over the next billion years after algae appeared
Name three greenhouse gases. | Water vapour, CO₂, and CH₄ (methane)
Why are greenhouse gases important? | They maintain temperatures on Earth high enough to support life
Describe step 1 of the greenhouse effect. | Electromagnetic radiation from the sun passes through Earth's atmosphere
Describe step 2 of the greenhouse effect. | Earth absorbs some radiation and warms up, then radiates heat as infrared radiation
Describe step 3 of the greenhouse effect. | Greenhouse gases absorb some infrared radiation from Earth
Describe step 4 of the greenhouse effect. | The atmosphere warms up, causing the greenhouse effect and global warming
What does "anthropogenic" mean? | Caused by human activity
Give two examples of human activities that increase greenhouse gases. | Driving (increases CO₂) and raising livestock like cows (increases CH₄)
Why is climate change modeling difficult? | Global climate systems are very complex to model
What problems can arise from simplified climate models? | Speculation and biased opinions in media based on only parts of the evidence
What evidence supports human-caused climate change? | Graphs showing correlation between atmospheric CO₂ levels and fossil fuel consumption
What causes climate change? | Increased levels of greenhouse gases like CO₂ and CH₄ leading to higher global temperatures
Name three potential effects of climate change. | Species extinction, rising sea levels from melting ice caps, increased skin cancer risk from UV rays
What should be considered when assessing greenhouse gas risks? | The scale of increased CO₂ and CH₄ levels, the risk they pose, and environmental implications
What substances are released when fuels burn completely? | Carbon dioxide, water vapour, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulates
What happens during partial combustion? | Soot particles, unburnt fuel, and carbon monoxide are released due to insufficient oxygen
What problems does carbon monoxide cause? | It's toxic and causes breathing difficulties
What problems do sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides cause? | Acid rain
What problem do solid particles cause? | Global dimming
What is potable water? | Water suitable for drinking with low levels of microbes and contaminants
Is potable water the same as pure water? | No, but it's still safe to drink
What are the three steps to make waste/ground water potable? | 1. Sedimentation (large particles sink), 2. Filtration (through sand beds), 3. Chlorination (chlorine kills microbes)
How do you make seawater potable using distillation? | 1. Filter seawater, 2. Boil it, 3. Cool and condense the water vapour
Why must water used in analysis be pure? | Dissolved salts could react with substances being analyzed, giving false results
