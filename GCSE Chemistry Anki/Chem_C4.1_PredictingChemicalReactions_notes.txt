How many electrons do Group 1 metals have in their outer shell? | 1 electron
What happens when Group 1 metals react with water? | They create an alkaline solution and hydrogen gas
What do Group 1 metals form when they react with oxygen? | An oxide
What do Group 1 metals form when they react with chlorine? | A white precipitate
How does reactivity change going down Group 1? | Reactivity increases going down the group
How many electrons do noble gases have in their outer shell? | 8 electrons (except helium which has 2)
Why are noble gases unreactive? | They have a stable arrangement of electrons
How do boiling points change going down Group 0? | Boiling points increase with increasing relative atomic mass
How many electrons do halogens have in their outer shell? | 7 electrons
What type of elements are halogens? | Non-metals that consist of molecules made of pairs of atoms
What charge does a halide ion carry? | -1 charge
What can a more reactive halogen do to a less reactive one? | Displace it from an aqueous solution of its salt
Why do halogens become less reactive going down the group? | The higher the energy level of outer electrons, the less easily electrons are gained
How do melting and boiling points change going down Group 7? | They increase with higher relative molecular mass
How do transition metals compare to Group 1 metals in terms of hardness? | They are harder and stronger
How do transition metals' melting points compare to Group 1 metals? | They have higher melting points (except mercury)
How do transition metals' density compare to Group 1 metals? | They have higher density
How reactive are transition metals compared to Group 1 metals? | Much less reactive and don't react as vigorously with oxygen or water
Name 6 examples of transition metals. | Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu
What is special about transition metal ions? | They have many different charges
What type of compounds do transition metals form? | Coloured compounds
What are transition metals useful as? | Catalysts
What type of ions do elements on the left side of the periodic table form? | Positive ions
What type of ions do elements on the right side of the periodic table form? | Negative ions
What does the group number tell you about an element? | How many electrons are in its outer shell
How do metals react to form compounds? | By forming positive ions
What makes one metal more reactive than another? | Greater tendency to form a positive ion = more reactive metal
What is the word equation for metal + dilute acid? | Metal + dilute acid → salt + hydrogen
What is the word equation for metal + water? | Metal + water → metal hydroxide + hydrogen
Which metals react with dilute acids? | Only the most reactive metals
How can you determine the order of reactivity from experiments? | Those with the most vigorous reactions are most reactive; those that don't react are least reactive
