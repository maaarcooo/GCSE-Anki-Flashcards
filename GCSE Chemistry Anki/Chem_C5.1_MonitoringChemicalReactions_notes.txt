What is the unit for concentration in chemistry? | mol/dm³ (moles per cubic decimetre)
What is the formula to calculate moles from concentration and volume? | moles = concentration × volume (mol = mol/dm³ × dm³)
What happens to concentration if you increase the volume but keep moles the same? | Concentration decreases (larger volume = lower concentration)
What happens to concentration if you increase the number of moles but keep volume the same? | Concentration increases (more moles = higher concentration)
What is the formula for concentration using mass? (HT) | concentration = mass of solute ÷ volume of solution
What is titration? | A technique to measure the volumes of acid and alkali solutions that react with each other using an indicator
List the 6 steps of titration method. | 1. Add acid to burette, record starting volume 2. Add known volume of alkali to conical flask with indicator 3. Place flask on white tile 4. Add acid until end point reached 5. Calculate titre (volume added) 6. Repeat for concordant titres
Why do you place the conical flask on a white tile during titration? | So you can see the colour change clearly
What is a titre? | The volume of acid that has been added during titration
What are concordant titres? | Repeated titration results that are very close to each other (showing accuracy)
How do you calculate the concentration of alkali if you know the acid concentration? (HT) | 1. Calculate moles of acid (conc × vol) 2. Use equation to find mole ratio 3. Calculate moles of alkali using ratio 4. Calculate alkali concentration (mol ÷ volume)
What conversion do you need to remember for volume units? (HT) | 1 dm³ = 1000 cm³
What volume does 1 mole of any gas occupy at RTP? (HT) | 24 dm³
What does RTP stand for? (HT) | Room Temperature and Pressure (20°C and 1 atmosphere pressure)
What is the formula for gas volume at RTP in dm³? (HT) | Volume (dm³) = moles × 24
What is the formula for gas volume at RTP in cm³? (HT) | Volume (cm³) = moles × 24,000
If you have 3 moles of oxygen gas at RTP, what volume would it occupy? (HT) | 3 × 24 = 72 dm³
How do you calculate moles from mass? | moles = mass ÷ molar mass
How do you calculate moles from gas volume? (HT) | moles = volume ÷ 24
How do you calculate mass from moles? | mass = moles × molar mass
How do you calculate gas volume from moles? (HT) | volume = moles × 24
What are the steps to calculate theoretical yield? | 1. Calculate moles of reactant 2. Use mole ratio from balanced equation 3. Calculate moles of product 4. Convert to mass or volume
What is the formula for percentage yield? | Percentage yield = (Amount of product produced ÷ Maximum amount possible) × 100
What does percentage yield tell you? | How much product was actually made compared to the theoretical maximum
What is atom economy? | A measure of how much of the reactants become useful products (efficiency of reaction)
What is the formula for atom economy? (HT) | Atom economy = (Mr of desired product ÷ Sum of Mr of all reactants) × 100
What factors might influence choice of reaction pathway? (HT) | Atom economy, yield, rate, equilibrium position, and usefulness of by-products
