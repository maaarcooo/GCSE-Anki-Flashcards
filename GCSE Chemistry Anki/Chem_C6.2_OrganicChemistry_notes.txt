What are the first 4 carbon prefixes? (Use the mnemonic MEPB) | Meth- (1C), Eth- (2C), Prop- (3C), But- (4C) - "Monkeys Eat Peanut Butter"
What suffix do alkanes have and what bonds do they contain? | -ane suffix, contain C-C and C-H bonds only
What suffix do alkenes have and what bond makes them different? | -ene suffix, contain C=C double bonds
What suffix do alcohols have and what functional group do they contain? | -ol suffix, contain -OH functional group
What suffix do carboxylic acids have and what functional group do they contain? | -anoic acid suffix, contain -COOH functional group
What are the products when alkanes combust completely? | Carbon dioxide and water
What happens when alkenes react with bromine and why is this useful? | Bromine changes from orange to colorless - used as a test for C=C double bonds
What happens when alkenes react with hydrogen? | Addition reaction occurs (hydrogen adds across the double bond)
How can alcohols be oxidized to carboxylic acids? | Using potassium manganate(VII) with reflux - color changes from orange to green
What are polymers made from? | Large molecules built up from small units called monomers
What happens to the C=C bond during addition polymerization? | The C=C double bond is removed to form a C-C single bond
What is a repeat unit in addition polymerization? | The monomer without the C=C double bond
How do you find the monomer from an addition polymer? | Add a C=C double bond to the repeat unit
What is produced as a by-product in condensation polymerization? | A small molecule (often water)
What is a diol? | A molecule with 2 alcohol (-OH) functional groups
What is a dicarboxylic acid? | A molecule with 2 carboxylic acid (-COOH) functional groups
What type of polymer is formed when a diol reacts with a dicarboxylic acid? | A polyester
What small molecule is lost when diol and dicarboxylic acid react? | Water (H from alcohol + OH from carboxylic acid)
What are the two main types of condensation polymers? | Polyesters (alcohol + carboxylic acid) and polyamides (amine + carboxylic acid)
How do you make a polyester practically? (HT) | Heat alcohol and carboxylic acid together with an acid catalyst
What type of polymer is DNA? | A polymer made from four different monomers called nucleotides
What are the four nucleotides in DNA? | Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), and Thymine (T)
What determines the reactions of organic compounds? | The functional groups present
How does fractional distillation separate crude oil? | Oil is heated, evaporates, then condenses at different temperatures based on boiling points
Where are longer chain alkanes collected in fractional distillation? | Towards the bottom due to higher boiling points and stronger intermolecular forces
What is the general formula for alkanes found in crude oil fractions? | CₙH₂ₙ₊₂
What is crude oil a main source of? | Hydrocarbons and feedstock for the petrochemical industry
What is refinery gas used for? | Bottled gas for heating and cooking
What is the gasoline fraction used for? | Fuel (petrol) for cars
What is kerosene/paraffin used for? | Jet fuel
What is bitumen used for? | Making roads
What is the purpose of cracking hydrocarbons? | To produce smaller, more useful molecules
What are the two methods of cracking? | 1) Pass vapors over hot catalyst (silica/alumina) 2) Mix with steam and heat to 600-700°C
What are the products of cracking? | Alkanes and alkenes (or hydrogen)
What does a chemical cell produce? | A potential difference until the reactants are used up
What is the overall reaction in a hydrogen/oxygen fuel cell? | 2H₂(g) + O₂(g) → 2H₂O(l)
What are the advantages of hydrogen/oxygen fuel cells? | Greater efficiency than other fuel cells, only emits water (no CO₂)
What are the disadvantages of hydrogen/oxygen fuel cells? | Production uses finite resources, transport/storage is difficult, explosive and dangerous
Why is crude oil considered a finite resource? | It takes millions of years to form and we're using it faster than it can be replenished
