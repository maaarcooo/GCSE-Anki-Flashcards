What is a bit? | The smallest unit of data a computer can store (1 binary digit), which can only hold one value (0 or 1)
What is a byte? | 8 bits, enough to store a single character
How many bytes in a kilobyte? | 1000 bytes (10^3 bytes)
How many bytes in a megabyte? | 1,000,000 bytes (10^6 bytes) or 1000 kilobytes
How many bytes in a gigabyte? | 1,000,000,000 bytes (10^9 bytes) or 1000 megabytes
How many bytes in a terabyte? | 1,000,000,000,000 bytes (10^12 bytes) or 1000 gigabytes
How do you convert from larger to smaller units of data storage? | Multiply by 1000 (e.g., 2 TB = 2000 GB)
How do you convert from smaller to larger units of data storage? | Divide by 1000 (e.g., 2000 KB = 2 MB)
How do you convert between bits and bytes? | 8 bits = 1 byte, so multiply bytes by 8 to get bits, or divide bits by 8 to get bytes
Why do computers use binary? | Computers are built using switches/transistors that can only be on (1) or off (0), making binary the most efficient number system for computers to process
How do you calculate the size of a text file? | (Bytes per character) × (Number of characters)
How do you calculate the size of an image file? | (Resolution) × (Colour Depth)
How do you calculate the size of a sound file? | (Sample Rate) × (Duration in seconds) × (Bit Depth)
How do you convert from denary to binary? | Write binary headings (128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1), check if denary number > column heading, write 1 if yes and subtract value, write 0 if no, repeat for each column
How do you convert from binary to denary? | Write binary headings (128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1), add together the values where the binary digit is 1
What are the rules for binary addition? | 0 + 0 = 0, 0 + 1 = 1, 1 + 0 = 1, 1 + 1 = 10 (carry 1), 1 + 1 + 1 = 11 (carry 1)
What is an overflow error in binary addition? | When the result of a binary addition exceeds the available bits (e.g., adding 1 to 11111111 would need a 9th bit)
What is hexadecimal? | A base-16 number system using 16 digits (0-9 and A-F) where A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15
Why is hexadecimal used in computing? | It takes fewer digits to represent large values than binary, making it easier to read and less prone to errors
How do you convert from binary to hexadecimal? | Split the binary into 4-bit nibbles, convert each nibble to its denary/hex value, then join them together
How do you convert from hexadecimal to binary? | Convert each hex digit to its 4-bit binary equivalent, then join them together
What is a binary left shift? | Moving each binary digit one place to the left, which multiplies the number by 2
What is a binary right shift? | Moving each binary digit one place to the right, which divides the number by 2
What are character sets? | Defined lists of characters that can be understood by computers, where each character has a unique binary code
What is ASCII? | A character set using 7 bits that can represent 128 characters (mainly English alphabet, numbers, and basic symbols)
What is Extended ASCII? | A character set using 8 bits that can represent 256 characters (includes more symbols and characters)
What is Unicode? | A character set using minimum 16 bits that can represent at least 65,536 characters (supports multiple languages and special characters like emojis)
What are the advantages of ASCII over Unicode? | ASCII uses less storage space (7-8 bits vs. 16+ bits)
What are the advantages of Unicode over ASCII? | Unicode can represent more characters (65,536+ vs. 128/256), supports languages worldwide, and includes special characters like emojis
What is a bitmap image? | An image made up of pixels (small squares), where each pixel is stored as a binary code representing its color
What is a vector image? | An image created from mathematical equations and points, storing only the mathematics needed to create the image
What is resolution in images? | The total amount of pixels that make up a bitmap image, calculated by multiplying height × width in pixels
What is colour depth? | The number of bits stored per pixel in a bitmap image, determining how many colors can be represented
How do you calculate the number of colors available from a color depth? | 2^(color depth) (e.g., 8-bit color depth = 2^8 = 256 colors)
What happens to file size when resolution increases? | File size increases as more pixels need to be stored
What happens to file size when color depth increases? | File size increases as more bits are needed per pixel
What is metadata for images? | Additional information stored with the image such as author, date/time, location, resolution, and color depth
How is sound sampled and stored digitally? | Measurements (samples) of the analogue sound wave's amplitude are taken at regular intervals and stored as binary values
What is sample rate in sound recording? | The number of samples taken per second, measured in Hertz (Hz)
What is bit depth in sound recording? | The number of bits used to store each sample, determining the range of possible values
How does increasing sample rate affect sound quality and file size? | Higher sample rate = better sound quality but larger file size
How does increasing bit depth affect sound quality and file size? | Higher bit depth = better sound quality (more precise measurements) but larger file size
What is compression? | Reducing the size of a file so it takes up less space on secondary storage
What is lossy compression? | Compression where data is permanently lost to reduce file size, irreversible but achieves greater size reduction
What is lossless compression? | Compression where data is encoded to reduce file size without losing information, reversible but achieves less size reduction
Which compression type is better for photographs? | Lossy compression is typically used for photographs since small quality reductions are often acceptable for significant file size reduction
Which compression type is better for text documents? | Lossless compression is better for documents where no data loss is acceptable
What does A2D stand for in sound processing? | Analogue to Digital conversion
What is the typical sampling rate for CD-quality audio? | 44.1 kHz (44,100 samples per second)
What is a binary nibble? | 4 bits, half a byte
What is true color in images? | 24-bit color depth allowing for 16,777,216 possible colors
Why would you use compression? | To maximize storage space on devices and minimize transfer time when uploading/downloading data across networks
