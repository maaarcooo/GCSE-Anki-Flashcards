What is malware? | Software created with malicious intent to cause harm to a computer system
What are 3 examples of issues caused by malware? | Files being deleted/corrupted/encrypted, slow/unusable internet connection, and computer crashing/shutting down
What is a virus? | A program that can replicate itself on a computer and contains code that causes unwanted events like corrupting files, deleting data, or preventing applications from running correctly
How do worms differ from viruses? | Worms are similar to viruses but can spread to other drives and computers on the network
How can worms infect other computers? | Through infected websites, instant messaging, email, and network connections
What is a Trojan? | Malware that disguises itself as legitimate software but contains malicious code in the background
What is spyware? | Software embedded in other programs that allows someone to spy on user activities, record screens, and log keystrokes to gain access to passwords
What is ransomware? | Malware that locks your computer and encrypts your files, then demands money to provide the password to decrypt them
What is social engineering? | Exploiting weaknesses in a computer system by targeting the people that use or have access to them
Name 3 examples of social engineering | Fraudulent phone calls, phishing emails, and pretexting (fake text messages)
Why are people considered the weak point in a system? | Because human errors can lead to significant issues like not locking doors, not logging out, sharing passwords, not encrypting data, and not keeping software updated
What is a brute-force attack? | Repeatedly trying multiple combinations of a user's password to gain unauthorized access to accounts or devices
What is a dictionary attack? | A form of brute-force attack that tries popular words or phrases as passwords to guess them quickly
What is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack? | Repeatedly sending requests to a server to flood it with traffic, causing it to overload and become unusable
How does a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack differ from DoS? | In DDoS, traffic comes from multiple distributed devices in a coordinated attack on a single server/network
What is a botnet? | A network of compromised devices infected with malware that can be controlled remotely by an attacker
What is the purpose of a DoS attack? | To prevent customers from accessing services, causing companies to lose money and damage their reputation
What is data interception and theft? | When hackers compromise usernames, passwords, and sensitive data by intercepting network transfers using tools like packet sniffers
What is a packet sniffer? | A device that can collect data being transferred on a network
What is SQL? | Structured Query Language - a language used to create, access, and manipulate databases
What is SQL injection? | Entering an SQL command into a web text field to manipulate the SQL query to insert, modify, or delete data from a database
What is penetration testing? | A company employs people to try hacking their network to identify vulnerabilities so they can be fixed
Which form of attack does penetration testing help prevent? | SQL injection
What is anti-malware software? | A combination of different software (anti-virus, anti-spam, anti-spyware) that prevents computers from being susceptible to malicious software
How does anti-malware work? | It scans email attachments, websites, and downloads for issues, blocks known malware signatures, and checks for updates to keep its database current
What is a firewall? | A barrier between a network and the internet that filters requests to prevent unwanted traffic from entering a network
What's the difference between hardware and software firewalls? | Hardware firewalls protect the whole network while software firewalls protect individual devices on the network
What are user access levels? | Designated roles on a network that limit what users can access based on their needs
Give examples of different access levels on a school network | Administrators (unrestricted), Teaching Staff (partially restricted), Students (restricted)
How are passwords typically stored in databases? | As encrypted/ciphered text entries so that even with unauthorized database access, hackers can't see the actual passwords
What is encryption? | A method of converting plain text into ciphered text using complex mathematical algorithms
What is asymmetric encryption? | Also known as private key, public key encryption - often used for web pages and communications
What are three examples of physical security measures? | Locked doors, biometrics (fingerprint/facial/retinal scans), and surveillance cameras
Which preventative measures help against malware? | Anti-malware software, firewalls, encryption, and physical security
Which preventative measures help against social engineering? | User access levels & passwords and physical security
Which preventative measure helps against brute-force attacks? | User access levels & passwords
Which preventative measure helps against denial of service attacks? | Firewalls
Which preventative measures help against data interception & theft? | Encryption and physical security
Which preventative measures help against SQL injection? | Penetration testing and user access levels & passwords
