What is defensive design? | An approach to software development where every possible input from a user is considered to anticipate all ways a user could misuse a program, ensuring the final program is robust and reliable.
Name three types of errors that software developers must anticipate. | Peripheral errors, disk errors, and communication errors.
What are examples of peripheral errors? | Printer issues such as running out of paper, running out of ink, or paper jams.
What are examples of disk errors? | Disk running out of space, files/folders not being found, and corrupted files.
What are communication errors? | Issues with connections to host servers when using online systems.
What is authentication? | The process of ensuring a system is secure by asking users to complete tasks to prove they are authorized users.
Name two methods of authentication. | Usernames/passwords and CAPTCHA.
What is input validation? | Code used to check that an input from a user is acceptable and matches the requirements of the program.
What are the 5 main categories of validation? | Length check, type check, range check, presence check, and format check.
What does a length check do? | Checks the length of a string, such as ensuring a password is 8 or more characters.
What does a type check do? | Checks the data type of a field, such as ensuring age is entered as an integer.
What does a range check do? | Ensures the data entered as a number falls within a particular range, such as checking a user's age is between 0-100.
What does a presence check do? | Looks to see if any data has been entered in a field, ensuring a required field is not left blank.
What does a format check do? | Ensures data has been entered in the correct format, such as ensuring an email includes @ and a period.
What Python function checks if a string contains only digits? | string.isdigit()
What is program maintainability? | Ensuring programmers can easily understand what a program is doing months or years after writing it, and enabling large teams to understand each section of code.
Name five ways to maintain programs. | Commenting, white space, indentation, sensible variable names, and use of sub-programs.
How do comments help with maintainability? | They explain the purpose of code in a particular section.
How does white space help with maintainability? | It makes each section clear and easy to see.
How does indentation help with maintainability? | It shows each instance of selection and iteration and makes it clear which code belongs to which clause.
How do sensible variable names help with maintainability? | The name explains what the variable or data structure does and prevents confusion later.
How do sub-programs help with maintainability? | They split programs into reusable sections which can remove the need for duplicating code and increase overall structure.
What are the four main reasons for testing programs? | To ensure no errors/bugs, to ensure code performs as intended, to ensure no unauthorized access, and to check the program solves the initial problem.
What are the two types of testing? | Iterative testing and final testing.
What is iterative testing? | Testing each part of a program and every pathway during development, repeatedly testing while making changes and improvements.
What is final testing? | Testing that all parts of a program work together, checking against real data, and using normal/boundary/erroneous data after development is complete.
What are two types of final testing? | Alpha testing and beta testing.
What is a syntax error? | An error that breaks the grammatical rules of a programming language and stops it from running.
What is a logic error? | Incorrect code that allows the program to run but produces an incorrect or undesired output.
How can you identify syntax errors? | The program will not execute, and the IDE will provide information about what the error is.
What are three common areas to check for logic errors? | Logical operators (<, >, ==, !=), Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT), and division by 0.
What debugging tip should you follow when an error message points to a specific line? | Check the line above the one identified in the error message, as the error is often there.
What are the three main categories of tests? | Normal tests, boundary tests, and erroneous tests.
What is a normal test? | When a user enters data that should be accepted in the program (within expected range).
What is a boundary test? | When a user enters data that is on the edge of what is acceptable (minimum or maximum values).
What is an erroneous test? | When a user enters data that is the wrong data type.
What is an invalid test? | When a user enters data that is the right data type but outside of what is accepted (out of range).
If a program accepts ages 12-18, what would be boundary test values? | 12 and 18.
If a program accepts ages 12-18, what would be normal test values? | Any value between 13 and 17 (such as 16).
If a program accepts ages 12-18, what would be an invalid test value? | Any age below 12 or above 18 (such as 8 or 25).
If a program accepts ages as integers, what would be an erroneous test value? | Any non-integer input (such as "F" or "sixteen").
