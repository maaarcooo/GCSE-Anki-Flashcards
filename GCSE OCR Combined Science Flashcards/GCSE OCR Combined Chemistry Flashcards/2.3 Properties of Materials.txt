What group is carbon located in on the periodic table? | Group 4
How many covalent bonds can carbon form? | Four covalent bonds
What are allotropes? | Different forms of the same element
How many carbon atoms does each carbon atom bond with in diamond? | Four other carbon atoms, forming a tetrahedron
Does diamond conduct electricity? | No, it does not conduct electricity
Why doesn't diamond conduct electricity? | All outer shell electrons are held in covalent bonds, so there are no freely moving charged particles
What is diamond's melting point like? | Very high melting point
Why does diamond have a very high melting point? | The four covalent bonds are very strong and extend in a giant lattice, requiring large amounts of energy to break
What is diamond's density? | 3.51 g/cm³
What are two uses of diamond? | Jewellery and coating blades in cutting tools
How many carbon atoms does each carbon bond with in graphite? | Three others, forming layers of hexagons
Does graphite conduct electricity? | Yes, graphite conducts electricity
Why can graphite conduct electricity? | Each carbon has one free electron that can migrate along the layers and carry charge
Why is graphite soft and slippery? | Layers are attracted by weak intermolecular forces, so they can slide over each other
What is graphite's density? | 2.25 g/cm³
What are three uses of graphite? | Pencils, industrial lubricant (engines and locks), and inert electrodes for electrolysis
What is graphene? | A single layer of graphite - a sheet of carbon atoms covalently bonded in a continuous hexagonal layer
How thick is graphene? | One atom thick (essentially a 2D molecule)
Does graphene conduct electricity? | Yes, it has free electrons that move along its surface
Is graphene strong or weak? | Extremely strong but also amazingly light
Is graphene transparent? | Yes, it absorbs only 2.3% of visible light
Is graphene flexible? | Yes, the strong bonds between carbon atoms are very flexible
What are fullerenes? | Carbon allotropes that form hollow tubes or spheres
What shapes do fullerenes usually contain? | Hexagons, but can also contain pentagons or heptagons
What was the first fullerene discovered? | Buckminsterfullerene (buckyball)
How many carbon atoms are in buckminsterfullerene? | 60 carbon atoms forming 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons
What are three uses of fullerenes? | Targeted drug delivery systems, catalysts, and lubricants
What are nanotubes? | Graphene rolled into a cylinder - a type of fullerene
What is a key property of nanotubes? | High tensile strength and resistance to breaking or stretching
Do nanotubes conduct electricity? | Yes, like graphene they can conduct electricity
What does the energy needed for a state change depend on? | The strength of forces between particles
What happens during melting? | A solid changes into a liquid
What is required for melting? | Heat energy which transforms into kinetic energy
What happens during boiling? | A liquid changes into a gas
Where do bubbles form during boiling? | Below the surface of the liquid and from within the liquid
What happens during freezing? | A liquid changes into a solid
At what temperature does water freeze and melt? | 0°C
What happens during evaporation? | A liquid changes into a gas
Where does evaporation occur? | Only at the surface of liquids
What happens during condensation? | A gas changes into a liquid, usually on cooling
What happens during sublimation? | A solid changes directly into a gas
What two substances can sublimate? | Iodine and solid carbon dioxide
If the temperature is below the melting point, what state is the substance? | Solid state
If the temperature is between melting and boiling points, what state is the substance? | Liquid state
If the temperature is above the boiling point, what state is the substance? | Gas state
What are bulk properties? | Physical properties that arise from many atoms, ions or molecules acting together
Give two examples of bulk properties. | Electrical conductivity and melting/boiling points
Do individual atoms possess bulk properties? | No, they arise from many atoms acting together
Why don't simple molecules conduct electricity? | There are no free charged particles
Why do ionic compounds conduct when molten or dissolved? | Ions are free to move and carry a charge
Why don't giant covalent structures conduct electricity? | There are no free charged particles (except graphite and fullerenes)
Why do metals conduct electricity? | Delocalised electrons are free to move and carry charge throughout the structure
What does brittle mean? | A substance cracks or breaks when external force is applied
What does malleable mean? | A substance changes shape without cracking or breaking
Why are metals malleable? | Atoms are arranged in layers which slide over each other when force is applied
Why are ionic and giant covalent substances brittle? | Their bonds break if force is applied
What is the state of most polymers at room temperature? | Solid
What types of forces exist in polymers? | Strong covalent bonds between atoms but intermolecular forces between polymer molecules
How do polymer intermolecular forces compare to simple molecules? | Larger than simple molecules but weaker than ionic or covalent bonds
