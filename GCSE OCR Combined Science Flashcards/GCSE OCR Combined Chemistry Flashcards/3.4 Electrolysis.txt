What is electrolysis? | The breakdown of an ionic compound when an electric current is passed through it (molten or in solution).
What is an electrolyte? | A liquid or solution that can conduct electricity (ionic compound molten or dissolved).
Why can't covalent compounds undergo electrolysis? | They cannot conduct electricity.
What is an electrode? | A rod of metal or graphite through which electric current flows into or out of an electrolyte.
What is the anode? | The positive electrode in electrolysis.
What is the cathode? | The negative electrode in electrolysis.
What is a cation? | A positively charged ion attracted to the cathode.
What is an anion? | A negatively charged ion attracted to the anode.
What mnemonic helps remember which electrode is positive/negative? | PANIC - Positive Anode Negative Is Cathode.
Why can't solid ionic compounds conduct electricity? | Ions are in fixed positions and cannot move to carry charge.
When can ionic compounds conduct electricity? | When molten or dissolved in solution (ions can move freely).
Which direction do electrons flow during electrolysis? | From anode to cathode (alphabetical order).
Which direction do positive ions move during electrolysis? | Towards the cathode (negative electrode).
Which direction do negative ions move during electrolysis? | Towards the anode (positive electrode).
What is a binary ionic compound? | A compound with just two elements joined by ionic bonding.
What products form from electrolysis of binary molten compounds? | The metal at the cathode and the non-metal at the anode.
What product always forms at the cathode in molten binary compounds? | The metal.
What product always forms at the anode in molten binary compounds? | The non-metal.
Why must electrodes be inert? | So they don't participate in side reactions with the electrolyte.
What are common inert electrode materials? | Graphite or platinum.
What ions do water molecules produce during electrolysis? | H⁺ and OH⁻ ions.
What determines which ions are discharged in aqueous solutions? | Relative reactivity of the elements involved.
At the anode, which ions are discharged if halides are present? | Halide ions (Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻) are discharged to form halogens.
At the anode, what is discharged if no halides are present? | OH⁻ ions are discharged to form oxygen gas.
At the cathode, when is hydrogen produced instead of the metal? | When the metal is above hydrogen in the reactivity series.
At the cathode, when is the metal produced? | When the metal is below hydrogen in the reactivity series (less reactive than hydrogen).
Which ion is more likely to be discharged - concentrated or dilute? | The more concentrated ion.
What is oxidation in terms of electrons? | Loss of electrons.
What is reduction in terms of electrons? | Gain of electrons.
What happens at the anode in terms of oxidation/reduction? | Oxidation - negative ions lose electrons.
What happens at the cathode in terms of oxidation/reduction? | Reduction - positive ions gain electrons.
What is electroplating? | Coating metals in a thin layer of a different metal using electrolysis.
In electroplating, what is the cathode? | The object you want to coat.
In electroplating, what is the anode? | The metal you want to coat with.
In electroplating, what is the electrolyte? | A solution containing ions of the coating metal.
In purifying copper, what is the anode made of? | Impure copper ore.
In purifying copper, what is the cathode made of? | Pure copper.
In purifying copper, what is the electrolyte? | Copper(II) sulfate solution.
In purifying copper, what happens to the anode? | It decreases in mass as copper atoms lose electrons; impurities collect underneath.
In purifying copper, what happens to the cathode? | It increases in mass as copper ions gain electrons and form copper atoms.
What is the key difference between inert and non-inert electrodes? | Non-inert electrodes take part in the process; inert ones don't.
