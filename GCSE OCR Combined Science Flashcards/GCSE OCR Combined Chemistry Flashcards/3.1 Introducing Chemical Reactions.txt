When do you need brackets around compound ions in formulae? | When more than one of that ion is needed (e.g., Cu(OH)₂).
What is the Law of Conservation of Mass? | No matter is lost or gained during a chemical reaction; mass is always conserved.
Why must chemical equations be balanced? | To ensure the same number of atoms of each element on both sides, following the Law of Conservation of Mass.
Which elements must be written as molecules in equations? | H₂, N₂, O₂, F₂, Cl₂, Br₂, and I₂
What are the four state symbols? | (s) solid, (l) liquid, (g) gas, (aq) aqueous/dissolved in water
How do you balance a chemical equation? | Change the coefficients (numbers in front of formulae) by trial and error, checking one element at a time.
What should you balance last when balancing equations? | Elements that appear on their own.
[Higher Tier] What is an ionic equation? | An equation showing only the ions that change during a reaction, with spectator ions removed.
[Higher Tier] What are spectator ions? | Ions that appear unchanged on both sides of the equation and can be eliminated.
[Higher Tier] How do you write an ionic equation? | Write full equation, identify ionic substances, write ions separately, remove ions appearing on both sides.
[Higher Tier] What is a half equation? | An equation representing what happens to one reactant, including electrons to balance charges.
[Higher Tier] What is the Avogadro constant? | 6.02 × 10²³ mol⁻¹ (the number of particles in one mole).
[Higher Tier] What is one mole? | The amount of substance containing exactly 6.02 × 10²³ elementary entities.
[Higher Tier] What is molar mass? | The mass of one mole of a substance, equal to the relative atomic/formula mass in grams.
[Higher Tier] What is the formula linking mass, moles, and molar mass? | Moles = Mass ÷ Molar Mass (or use the formula triangle).
[Higher Tier] How do you calculate the mass of one atom? | Mass of 1 atom = Molar mass ÷ Avogadro constant
Why might a reaction appear to lose mass? | If a gaseous product escapes from a non-enclosed system.
Why might a reaction appear to gain mass? | If a gaseous reactant from the air reacts and all products are solid or liquid.
What happens in a closed system during a reaction? | The total mass remains constant as no substances can enter or leave.
Give an example of a reaction that appears to lose mass. | Metal carbonates thermally decomposing, releasing CO₂ gas.
Give an example of a reaction that appears to gain mass. | Metals reacting with oxygen from the air to form oxides.
[Higher Tier] What is stoichiometry? | The numbers (coefficients) in front of reactants and products in a balanced equation.
[Higher Tier] How do you balance an equation using moles? | Convert masses to moles, find the simplest whole number ratio, use this ratio as coefficients.
[Higher Tier] If initial mole calculations give 1, 2, and 2.5, what do you do? | Multiply all numbers by 2 to get whole numbers: 2, 4, and 5.
[Higher Tier] What is the limiting reactant? | The reactant that is used up first, limiting the amount of product formed.
[Higher Tier] What is the excess reactant? | The reactant that remains after the limiting reactant is completely used up.
[Higher Tier] How do you determine the limiting reactant? | Convert masses to moles, compare with the molar ratio from the balanced equation.
[Higher Tier] Why is the limiting reactant important in calculations? | It determines the maximum amount of product that can be formed.
[Higher Tier] How do you calculate mass of product from a balanced equation? | Convert given mass to moles, use molar ratio, convert moles of product to mass.
[Higher Tier] What are the steps for reacting mass calculations? | 1) Calculate moles of given substance, 2) Find ratio from equation, 3) Calculate moles of wanted substance, 4) Convert to mass.
When balancing equations, what should you count as one unit if it doesn't change? | Groups of atoms like nitrate (NO₃⁻) that remain together.
What does a coefficient of 2 in front of a formula mean? | Two molecules/formula units of that substance (e.g., 2H₂O means 2 water molecules).
Can you change the subscript numbers in formulae when balancing? | No, only change the coefficients in front; subscripts are fixed by the compound's formula.
