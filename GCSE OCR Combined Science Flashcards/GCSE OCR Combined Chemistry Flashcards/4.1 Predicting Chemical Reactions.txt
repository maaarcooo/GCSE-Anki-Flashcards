What are Group 1 metals also known as? | Alkali metals
Why are Group 1 metals called alkali metals? | They form alkaline solutions when they react with water
How many electrons do Group 1 metals have in their outer shell? | One electron
What happens to the softness of Group 1 metals as you go down the group? | They get softer
What happens to the melting point of Group 1 metals as you go down the group? | It decreases
What happens to the reactivity of Group 1 metals as you go down the group? | It increases
Why do Group 1 metals become more reactive down the group? | The outer electron is further from the nucleus, so weaker forces of attraction make it easier to lose
What charge do Group 1 metal ions have? | 1+ (positive one)
What is produced when Group 1 metals react with water? | Metal hydroxide and hydrogen gas
What is the word equation for alkali metals reacting with water? | metal + water → metal hydroxide + hydrogen
What happens when lithium reacts with water? | Relatively slow reaction, lithium doesn't melt, fizzing can be seen and heard
What happens when sodium reacts with water? | Large amounts of heat released causes sodium to melt, hydrogen catches fire
What happens when potassium reacts with water? | Reacts more violently than sodium, hydrogen burns with a lilac flame, melts into a shiny ball
What do Group 1 metals form when they react with oxygen? | Metal oxides
Why are alkali metals stored in oil? | To prevent them reacting with oxygen and water vapour in air
What is produced when Group 1 metals react with chlorine? | Metal chlorides (salts)
What are the Group 7 elements called? | Halogens
How many electrons do halogens have in their outer shell? | Seven electrons
What type of molecules do halogens form? | Diatomic molecules (pairs of atoms)
What charge do halide ions have? | 1- (negative one)
What is the state and colour of chlorine at room temperature? | Pale yellow-green gas
What is the state and colour of bromine at room temperature? | Red-brown liquid
What is the state and colour of iodine at room temperature? | Purple-black solid
What happens to the melting and boiling points of halogens as you go down the group? | They increase
What happens to the reactivity of halogens as you go down the group? | It decreases
Why do halogens become less reactive down the group? | The outer shell is further from the nucleus, making it harder to attract an electron
Which is the most reactive halogen? | Fluorine
What is a halogen displacement reaction? | When a more reactive halogen displaces a less reactive halogen from an aqueous solution
Will chlorine displace bromine from potassium bromide solution? | Yes, because chlorine is more reactive than bromine
What colour change occurs when chlorine displaces bromine? | Solution becomes orange
What colour change occurs when chlorine displaces iodine? | Solution becomes brown
Will iodine displace chlorine from potassium chloride? | No, because iodine is less reactive than chlorine
What ionic equation shows chlorine displacing bromide ions? | Cl₂ + 2Br⁻ → 2Cl⁻ + Br₂
What do halogens form when they react with metals? | Metal halides (ionic compounds)
What do halogens form when they react with non-metals? | Simple molecular covalent structures (e.g. hydrogen halides)
What are Group 0 elements called? | Noble gases
Why are noble gases unreactive? | They have full outer shells of electrons
How many electrons do noble gases have in their outer shell (except helium)? | Eight electrons (helium has 2)
What type of atoms are noble gases? | Monatomic (exist as single atoms)
What happens to the boiling point of noble gases as you go down the group? | It increases
Why do noble gases have low boiling points? | Weak intermolecular forces between atoms
What is helium used for? | Filling balloons and weather balloons (less dense than air and doesn't burn)
What are neon, argon and xenon used for? | Advertising signs
What is argon used for? | Providing inert atmosphere for welding and filling light bulbs
What is produced when metals react with acids? | Metal salt and hydrogen gas
What is the word equation for metal reacting with acid? | metal + acid → metal salt + hydrogen
What does the reactivity series show? | Metals arranged in order of their reactivity
Which metals react violently with water? | Potassium, sodium, lithium, calcium (most reactive)
Which metals react vigorously with acid? | Calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron
Which metals don't react with water or acid? | Copper, silver, gold (least reactive)
Why is carbon included in the reactivity series? | To predict whether a metal oxide can be reduced by carbon
Why is hydrogen included in the reactivity series? | To show which metals can displace hydrogen from acids/water
What is a displacement reaction? | When a more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from its compound
Will zinc displace copper from copper oxide? | Yes, because zinc is more reactive than copper
Will sodium displace zinc from zinc chloride? | Yes, because sodium is more reactive than zinc
Will copper displace iron from iron sulfate? | No, because copper is less reactive than iron
How can you extract metals below carbon in the reactivity series? | By heating the oxide with carbon
How must metals above carbon be extracted? | By electrolysis
What is the reactivity trend for Group 1 and 2 metals? | Get more reactive going down the group
What is the reactivity trend for Group 7 non-metals? | Get less reactive going down the group
What charge do transition metal ions have? | Variable charges (e.g. Fe²⁺ or Fe³⁺)
How do transition metals compare to Group 1 metals in hardness? | Transition metals are much harder and stronger
How do transition metals compare to Group 1 metals in density? | Transition metals are much denser
How do transition metals compare to Group 1 metals in melting point? | Transition metals have much higher melting points
How do transition metals compare to Group 1 metals in reactivity? | Transition metals are much less reactive
What happens when Group 1 metals are exposed to oxygen? | They tarnish quickly (within seconds) forming a dull metal oxide coating
How long does iron take to react with oxygen? | Several weeks (and requires water present)
