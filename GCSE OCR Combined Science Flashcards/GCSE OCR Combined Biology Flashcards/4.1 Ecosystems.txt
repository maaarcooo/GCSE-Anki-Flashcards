What is material cycling? | The process where biological molecules are broken down and re-used constantly, with breakdown products becoming building blocks for future life.
Why is material cycling important? | It prevents constant build-up of dead biomass and ensures biological materials don't run out.
Where does material cycling take place? | Between the atmosphere, biomass, land, and oceans.
What are the three main examples of cycled materials? | Water, nitrogen, and carbon.
Which organisms play a major role in material cycling? | Microorganisms, mainly bacteria and fungi.
What key roles do microorganisms play in the nitrogen cycle? | Decomposition, fixing nitrogen gas from atmosphere, nitrification (turning N₂ into nitrates), and denitrification (returning N₂ to atmosphere).
What roles do microorganisms play in the carbon cycle? | Photosynthesis, assisting animals to metabolise organic compounds, decomposition, and decay.
Why is the water cycle fundamental for all living things? | It distributes fresh water globally, provides clean drinking water, refreshes nutrient flow, and maintains habitats.
What are the three states water exists in on Earth? | Solid, liquid, and gas.
How is carbon taken out of the atmosphere? | In the form of carbon dioxide by plants for photosynthesis.
How is carbon passed to animals? | Via feeding on plants or other animals.
How is carbon returned to the atmosphere? | As carbon dioxide through respiration by plants, animals, and microorganisms.
What happens to carbon in dead organisms without decomposers? | Over millions of years and under pressure, it can be converted into fossil fuels.
What is combustion in the carbon cycle? | The burning of fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
How does deforestation affect the carbon cycle? | Burning trees releases more CO₂, and fewer trees means less CO₂ removed by photosynthesis.
What is a population? | A group of organisms of the same species living in the same place at the same time.
What is a community? | All of the populations living in the same area at the same time.
What is interdependence? | When each species in a community depends on other species for food, shelter, pollination, or seed dispersal.
What is a habitat? | The place where an organism lives.
What is an ecosystem? | All the biotic factors and all the abiotic factors that interact within an area at one time.
What are biotic factors? | All the living components of an ecosystem, such as plants and animals.
What are abiotic factors? | All the non-living components of an ecosystem, such as light intensity, mineral ions, and water availability.
Give three examples of ecosystem sizes. | A small ecosystem might be a garden pond; a large ecosystem might be the whole of Antarctica.
What does 'abiotic' mean? | Non-living.
How does light intensity affect plants? | Light is needed for photosynthesis; more light leads to increased rate of photosynthesis and plant growth.
How does temperature affect plants? | It affects the rate of photosynthesis in plants.
Why do plants and animals require water? | Plants and animals require water to survive.
How does soil pH affect plants? | Different plant species are adapted to different soil pH levels and nutrient concentration levels.
How does wind intensity affect plants? | Wind speed affects transpiration rate in plants, which affects photosynthesis as it ensures water and minerals are transported to leaves.
Why do plants need carbon dioxide? | CO₂ is required for photosynthesis; CO₂ concentration affects the rate of photosynthesis.
What oxygen levels do some aquatic animals need? | Some aquatic animals (such as fish) can only survive in water with high oxygen concentrations.
Give an example of how pollutants affect communities. | Some lichen species cannot grow if sulfur dioxide concentration rises above a certain level.
What does 'biotic' mean? | Living.
What are examples of biotic factors? | Competition, predation, camouflage, and disease.
How does food availability affect populations? | More food means organisms have a higher chance of surviving and reproducing, so populations can increase.
What happens when a new predator is introduced to an ecosystem? | If prey populations are wiped out, the predator population may also decline or be wiped out. The ecosystem may become unbalanced.
What happens when a new pathogen enters an ecosystem? | If populations have no immunity or resistance, they may decline or be wiped out.
What is competition? | When organisms need the same limited resource to survive and reproduce.
What is intraspecific competition? | Competition between members of the same species.
What is interspecific competition? | Competition between members of different species.
What resources do plants compete for? | Light, space, water from soil, and mineral ions from soil.
Why do plants compete for light? | Light is needed for photosynthesis to produce glucose, which provides energy for growth.
Why do plants compete for space? | Plants require space above soil (for maximum sunlight) and below soil (for water and mineral absorption).
Why do animals compete for food? | Food provides animals with the energy they require for growth and reproduction.
Why do animals compete for mates? | Animals require mates to reproduce and pass on their genes.
Why do animals compete for territory? | Territory provides an area of habitat with resources such as water, food, shelter, and mates.
What is parasitism? | When parasites live off a host organism, taking what they need and giving nothing in return, harming the host.
Give an example of an animal parasite. | Tapeworms attach to intestines of animals and feed on partly digested food, depriving the host of nutrients.
Give an example of a plant parasite. | Mistletoe anchors to host trees and gains water and nutrients from the tree's tissues.
Is parasitism win-win or win-lose? | Win-lose scenario.
What is mutualism? | When two species interact to mutually benefit each other.
Give an example of mutualism. | Bees get nectar from flowers for food, and flowers get pollinated in return.
How do sharks and cleaner wrasse show mutualism? | The wrasse cleans the shark's teeth by removing debris (gets food), and the shark gets clean, sharp teeth.
What is a stable community? | One where all species and environmental factors are in balance so population sizes remain fairly constant.
How does removing one species affect a food web? | It can affect the whole community due to interdependence.
What is the importance of carbon in living organisms? | Carbon is a component of all organic molecules, many of which are essential for life, such as glucose.
What are the global carbon reservoirs? | Atmosphere, biomass, oceans, and soil.
Why is the balance of carbon between reservoirs fundamental? | Due to the role that carbon plays in sustaining life.
What can happen if the global carbon balance is disrupted? | Organisms will suffer; global warming is a large-scale example of this effect.
