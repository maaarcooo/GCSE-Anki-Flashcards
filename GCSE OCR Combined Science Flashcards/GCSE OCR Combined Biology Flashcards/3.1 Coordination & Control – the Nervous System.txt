What are the two main divisions of the human nervous system? | Central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS)
What is the function of the nervous system? | To enable humans to react to their surroundings and coordinate their behaviour
What are electrical impulses? | Electrical signals that pass along nerve cells (neurones) to transmit information through the nervous system
What is a nerve? | A bundle of neurones
What is a stimulus? | A detectable change in the internal or external environment of an organism (e.g. light, sound, temperature)
What is a receptor? | A cell or organ which detects a stimulus
What is a neurone? | A nerve cell, specially adapted to carry electrical impulses from one part of the body to another
What does a sensory neurone do? | Carries nerve impulses from receptors to the central nervous system
What does a motor neurone do? | Carries nerve impulses from the central nervous system to effectors
What does a relay neurone do? | Acts as a coordinator, transmitting impulses from the sensory to the motor neurone in the spinal cord
What is an effector? | A cell, tissue, organ or organ system that responds to a stimulus (e.g. muscle or gland)
What is a voluntary response? | A nerve pathway which produces a conscious response to a stimulus
What is a reflex response? | A nerve pathway which produces an automatic response to a stimulus
What is a synapse? | A gap between two neurones
What is an axon? | A single long fibre within a neurone which carries a nervous impulse away from the cell body
What does the central nervous system (CNS) consist of? | Brain and spinal cord
What is the role of the CNS? | To coordinate the response by directing the electrical impulse to the correct effector
What type of neurones are found in the CNS? | Relay neurones
What does the peripheral nervous system (PNS) include? | All the nerves in the body that extend from the CNS and sensory receptors
Describe the pathway of an electrical impulse in a nervous response. | Receptor detects stimulus → sensory neurone → relay neurone in CNS → motor neurone → effector → response
What sense organ detects light? | Eye (sight)
What sense organ detects chemicals in food and drink? | Tongue (taste)
What sense organ detects chemicals in the air? | Nose (smell)
What does the ear detect? | Sound and movement (hearing and balance)
What does the skin detect? | Pressure, heat, cold (temperature) and pain (touch and temperature)
What is the myelin sheath? | A fatty layer that covers the axon to insulate it and increase the speed of the impulse
How do long axons help speed up transmission? | They reduce the number of synapses needed, speeding up transmission (some are over a metre long)
What are dendrites? | Branched endings that create links between neurones
How do neurotransmitters cross a synapse? | They are released from vesicles, diffuse across the synaptic gap, and bind with receptor molecules on the postsynaptic membrane
Why can't electrical impulses cross synapses? | Because synapses are gaps, so chemicals called neurotransmitters must transmit the impulse instead
Name two examples of neurotransmitters. | Dopamine and serotonin
Why do neurotransmitters slow down transmission? | Because they must diffuse across the synapse, which takes time
How do synapses ensure impulses travel in one direction? | Neurotransmitters are only released from the presynaptic neurone and receptors are only on the postsynaptic neurone
What happens to neurotransmitters after they trigger an impulse? | They are destroyed or recycled to prevent continued stimulation
What is a voluntary response? | A conscious decision to carry out an action that starts with the brain
Why do voluntary responses take longer than involuntary responses? | Because we consider what the response might be before doing it
What is a reflex arc? | The passage of information in an involuntary response
Why are reflex actions important? | They are rapid and essential to basic survival
Give an example of a reflex action. | Pulling your hand away from a hot object to prevent harm
What are the three main types of neurone in a reflex arc? | Sensory, relay and motor neurones
Describe the structure of a sensory neurone. | Long with a cell body branching off the middle of the axon
Describe the structure of a relay neurone. | Short with a small cell body at one end with many dendrites branching off
Describe the structure of a motor neurone. | Long with a large cell body at one end with long dendrites branching off
Describe the reflex arc pathway (6 steps). | 1) Receptor detects stimulus 2) Sensory neurone to spinal cord 3) Relay neurone in spinal cord 4) Relay synapses with motor neurone 5) Motor neurone to effector 6) Effector responds
Does the brain coordinate reflex responses? | No, reflexes are coordinated by the spinal cord or unconscious part of the brain
What is reaction time? | The time taken to respond to a stimulus (usually less than a second)
Name three factors that can affect reaction time. | Age, stress, use of drugs (such as caffeine)
In a ruler drop test, what does catching the ruler further down indicate? | Slower reaction time
What is the independent variable in a reaction time investigation? | The factor being changed (e.g. caffeine consumption or background noise)
What is the dependent variable in a reaction time investigation? | The reaction time being measured
Name three control variables for a ruler drop test. | Using dominant hand, same ruler from same height, same ruler orientation (0 cm facing down)
Why should experiments be repeated several times? | To calculate a mean average and improve reliability
What is an anomaly in results? | A result that is much higher or lower than other results and should not be included in the mean
If Student A has a reaction time of 255 ms and Student B has 262 ms, who is faster? | Student A (lower time = faster reaction)
Why is computer-based reaction time testing more accurate? | It removes human error from measurements and can record in milliseconds for more precision
