What is diffusion? | The net movement of particles from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.
Is diffusion a passive or active process? | Passive - it does not require energy.
What factors affect the rate of diffusion? | Temperature (higher temperature = more kinetic energy = faster diffusion) and concentration gradient.
What is a partially permeable membrane? | A membrane that allows some substances to pass through but not others.
Give two examples of substances that can diffuse across cell membranes. | Oxygen and carbon dioxide.
Why can't starch diffuse across cell membranes? | It is too large to pass through the membrane.
Where does oxygen diffuse in the lungs? | From alveolar air space into blood in capillaries around alveoli.
Where does carbon dioxide diffuse in the lungs? | From blood in capillaries around alveoli into alveolar air space.
What is osmosis? | The net movement of water molecules across a partially-permeable membrane from a region of higher water concentration to a region of lower water concentration.
Is osmosis active or passive transport? | Passive transport (does not require energy).
What is water potential? | The potential (likelihood) of water molecules to diffuse out of or into a solution.
Does a concentrated sugar solution have high or low water potential? | Low water potential (low concentration of water molecules).
Does pure water have high or low water potential? | The highest water potential of any solution.
What happens to an animal cell in a strong sugar solution? | It loses water by osmosis and becomes crenated (shrivelled).
What happens to an animal cell in distilled water? | It gains water by osmosis until the cell membrane bursts.
What happens to a plant cell in a strong sugar solution? | It loses water, the vacuole gets smaller, and the cell becomes flaccid (shrivelled).
What happens to a plant cell in distilled water? | It gains water, the vacuole gets bigger, and the cell becomes turgid.
What is turgor pressure? | The pressure of the cytoplasm pushing against the cell wall in a plant cell.
Why is turgor pressure important for plants? | It provides support and strength, making the plant stand upright with leaves held out to catch sunlight.
What happens when plants don't receive enough water? | Cells cannot remain turgid and the plant wilts.
What is active transport? | The movement of substances from a more dilute solution to a more concentrated solution (against a concentration gradient) using energy.
Does active transport require energy? | Yes, it requires energy in the form of ATP from cellular respiration.
What structures in the cell membrane are involved in active transport? | Protein carrier molecules.
Why do root hair cells use active transport? | To move mineral ions from lower concentration in soil to higher concentration inside the cell.
Why do plants need magnesium ions? | To make chlorophyll.
Why do plants need nitrate ions? | To make amino acids and proteins (for growth).
How does active transport help glucose absorption in the small intestine? | It allows glucose to be transported into the bloodstream even when concentration in the bloodstream is higher than in the intestine.
What is the key difference between diffusion and active transport? | Active transport requires energy and moves substances against a concentration gradient; diffusion is passive and moves substances down a concentration gradient.
What is the cell cycle? | The series of growth and development steps a cell undergoes from formation to division.
What are the three parts of the cell cycle? | Interphase, mitosis, and cytokinesis.
What happens during interphase? | Cell growth and DNA synthesis (DNA copies itself to form duplicate chromosomes).
What happens during mitosis? | Chromosomes line up along the centre of the cell and are pulled apart.
What happens during cytokinesis? | The cell cytoplasm and membrane divide to produce two daughter cells.
What type of cell division produces body cells? | Mitosis.
Are daughter cells produced by mitosis genetically identical? | Yes, they are genetically identical to the parent cell.
What are the main stages within mitosis? | DNA duplication, chromosomes line up in centre, cell fibres pull chromosomes apart, new nucleus forms around each group, cytoplasm and membrane divide.
What are cell fibres in mitosis? | Structures that attach to duplicated chromosomes and pull them apart.
What is a chromatid? | One arm (half) of a duplicated chromosome.
What is a specialised cell? | A cell with a particular structure and composition of subcellular structures to perform a specific function.
What is differentiation? | The process by which cells become specialised.
When do most animal cells differentiate? | At an early stage during development.
Can most animal cells differentiate after becoming specialised? | No, they lose the ability to differentiate (except stem cells).
Can plant cells differentiate throughout their life? | Yes, most plant cells retain the ability to differentiate throughout the plant's life.
Give three examples of specialised animal cells. | Nerve cells, red blood cells, sperm cells, egg cells, ciliated epithelial cells.
How are ciliated epithelial cells adapted? | Extensions of cytoplasm form cilia which beat to move mucus and trapped particles.
How are nerve cells adapted? | Long with extensions and branches to communicate with other nerve cells; axon covered with fatty sheath for insulation and faster impulse transmission.
How are red blood cells adapted? | Biconcave shape increases surface area; no nucleus to increase space for haemoglobin.
How are sperm cells adapted? | Head contains genetic material; acrosome contains digestive enzymes; mitochondria for energy; tail enables swimming.
How are egg cells (ovum) adapted? | Large cytoplasm with nutrients for embryo growth; haploid nucleus; cell membrane changes after fertilisation to prevent more sperm entering.
Give three examples of specialised plant cells. | Root hair cells, xylem vessels, palisade mesophyll cells.
How are root hair cells adapted? | Large surface area to maximise absorption; thin walls for quick water movement; no chloroplasts.
How are xylem vessels adapted? | No top and bottom walls form continuous column; dead cells without organelles for free water passage; walls thickened with lignin for support.
How are palisade mesophyll cells adapted? | Column shaped to maximise light absorption; many chloroplasts for maximum photosynthesis; positioned in upper epidermis layer.
What is a stem cell? | An undifferentiated cell capable of dividing to produce more stem cells and differentiating into other cell types.
What are embryonic stem cells? | Stem cells found in early embryos that can differentiate into any cell type.
What are adult stem cells? | Stem cells found in certain places (like bone marrow) that can only differentiate into a few cell types.
What is the main function of adult stem cells? | To maintain and repair damaged cells (e.g., in blood or skin).
Where are plant stem cells found? | In meristem tissue at roots and shoot tips.
Can plant stem cells differentiate into any cell type? | Yes, throughout the life of the plant.
What can plant stem cells be used for? | To clone plants with desired characteristics (e.g., disease resistance).
What is therapeutic cloning? | Producing an embryo with the same genes as a patient to extract stem cells that won't be rejected.
Why are embryonic stem cells useful in medicine? | They can differentiate into most types of specialised cells to repair damaged organs.
What is the advantage of using stem cells from therapeutic cloning? | They are not rejected by the patient's body, so no immune-suppressing drugs needed.
What age embryo provides the best source of embryonic stem cells? | A 5-day old embryo.
What diseases could stem cells potentially cure? | Diabetes, paralysis, and many others.
Give two benefits of using stem cells in medicine. | Great potential to treat many diseases; organs developed from patient's own stem cells reduce rejection risk.
Give two risks of using stem cells. | Cultured stem cells could become infected with viruses; risk of mutations leading to cancer.
What is a social issue with embryonic stem cells? | They can be collected before birth but this is expensive and not available to everyone; lack of peer-reviewed clinical evidence.
What is an ethical issue with embryonic stem cells? | Stem cells may be sourced from unused IVF embryos - is it right to use or create embryos then destroy them?
Why are low numbers of stem cell donors a problem? | Limited availability of stem cells for treatments.
