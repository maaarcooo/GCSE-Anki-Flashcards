Why do single-celled organisms not require transport systems? | They have a high SA:V ratio which allows efficient exchange of substances via simple diffusion. The large surface area allows maximum absorption and the small volume means short diffusion distances.
What happens to the SA:V ratio as organisms increase in size? | The SA:V ratio decreases. There is less surface area for absorption and a greater volume results in longer diffusion distances.
What is Fick's Law? | Rate of diffusion ∝ (surface area × concentration gradient) ÷ diffusion distance
According to Fick's Law, what happens if surface area doubles? | The rate of diffusion doubles.
What are the three transport processes living organisms use? | Diffusion, osmosis and active transport.
Name three factors that affect the rate of diffusion. | Surface area, diffusion distance, concentration gradient (also temperature).
How does temperature affect diffusion rate? | Higher temperature increases diffusion rate because molecules have more kinetic energy and move faster.
Why do larger organisms need exchange surfaces? | They have relatively small surface areas compared to their volumes, so diffusion, osmosis and active transport cannot occur sufficiently fast without exchange surfaces.
Name three substances organisms must take in. | Oxygen (for respiration), water (for transport and reactions), and dissolved food molecules (for energy and growth).
Why must plants take in carbon dioxide? | For photosynthesis.
Name two waste substances organisms must remove. | Urea and carbon dioxide.
Why is waste removal important? | If waste substances build up, they can have negative effects due to toxicity.
What does the circulatory system consist of? | A network of blood vessels connected to the heart and lungs.
Where does gas exchange occur in the lungs? | In the alveoli.
Why are alveoli effective for gas exchange? | They have a large surface area to volume ratio and thin walls to maximise gas exchange.
What is the double circulatory system? | Two circuits: pulmonary circuit (heart to lungs) and systemic circulation (heart to body).
What is an advantage of the double circulatory system? | Blood pressure can be raised after returning from the lungs, allowing faster delivery of oxygenated blood to cells.
What are the four chambers of the heart? | Right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, left ventricle.
Which blood vessel carries deoxygenated blood from the body to the heart? | Vena cava.
Which blood vessel carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart? | Pulmonary vein.
Which blood vessel carries deoxygenated blood from the heart to the lungs? | Pulmonary artery.
Which blood vessel carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the body? | Aorta.
What type of muscle is the heart made of? | Cardiac muscle which never gets tired.
Why does cardiac muscle contain many mitochondria? | To provide lots of ATP for energy as the heart beats continuously.
Which blood vessels supply the heart with oxygen and glucose? | Coronary arteries (branch off from the aorta).
What is the function of heart valves? | To prevent blood flowing backwards.
What do arteries carry? | Blood away from the heart at high pressure.
What do veins carry? | Blood towards the heart at low pressure.
What are capillaries involved in? | Exchange of materials with tissues.
Describe three features of arteries. | Thick muscular walls, narrow lumen, contain elastic fibres to stretch and recoil.
Describe three features of veins. | Thin walls, large lumen, contain valves to prevent backflow.
Describe two features of capillaries. | One cell thick walls (short diffusion distance), permeable walls (allow exchange).
Why do arteries have thick muscular walls? | To withstand high pressure and maintain blood pressure as they recoil.
Why do veins have valves? | To prevent backflow of blood as it is under low pressure.
Why are capillary walls one cell thick? | To provide a short diffusion distance for efficient exchange.
Why is blood flow slowest in capillaries? | Due to the high total cross-sectional area of all capillaries, which favours gas exchange.
What are the two main components of blood? | Red blood cells and plasma.
What percentage of blood is plasma? | Over 55%.
What is the function of red blood cells? | To carry oxygen from the lungs to cells throughout the body.
Describe the shape of red blood cells. | Biconcave disk shape.
What protein do red blood cells contain? | Haemoglobin (binds to oxygen to form oxyhaemoglobin).
Why do red blood cells have no nucleus? | To allow more space for haemoglobin.
Name three adaptations of red blood cells. | Biconcave shape (large SA:V ratio), full of haemoglobin, no nucleus (more space for haemoglobin).
What is plasma? | A straw-coloured liquid in which other blood components are suspended.
Name four substances transported in plasma. | Carbon dioxide, digested food, urea, hormones (also water, mineral ions, antibodies, heat energy).
What are root hair cells adapted for? | Efficient uptake of water (by osmosis) and mineral ions (by active transport).
Why do roots have millions of root hairs? | To increase surface area for absorption.
How does water enter root hair cells? | By osmosis (from higher water potential in soil to lower water potential in cytoplasm).
How do mineral ions enter root hair cells? | By active transport (against the concentration gradient, requires energy).
Why is active transport needed for mineral ion uptake? | Because mineral ion concentration in soil is lower than in root hair cells.
What is transpiration? | The evaporation and diffusion of water from plant surfaces (mainly leaves).
What is the transpiration stream? | The constant movement of water from roots to leaves through the xylem.
What are stomata? | Tiny pores (openings) that allow gas exchange.
What cells control the opening and closing of stomata? | Guard cells.
When do stomata typically open? | During the day (in light) to allow photosynthesis.
When do stomata typically close? | At night (in darkness) to conserve water.
What happens when guard cells become turgid? | The stomatal pore opens allowing gas exchange (and water loss).
What happens when guard cells become flaccid? | The stomatal pore closes reducing water loss.
How does high light intensity affect transpiration rate? | Increases transpiration (stomata open, guard cells turgid).
How does high temperature affect transpiration rate? | Increases transpiration (particles have more kinetic energy, evaporate faster).
How does high humidity affect transpiration rate? | Decreases transpiration (weaker concentration gradient).
How does high air movement affect transpiration rate? | Increases transpiration (removes water vapour, maintains concentration gradient).
What is translocation? | The transport of soluble products of photosynthesis (mainly sucrose) around the plant.
Is translocation an active or passive process? | Active process (requires energy).
Where does translocation occur? | In the phloem tubes.
What are sources in translocation? | Where substances are made (e.g., leaves in summer).
What are sinks in translocation? | Where substances are used or stored (e.g., roots for storage).
What do xylem vessels transport? | Water and mineral ions from roots to stem and leaves.
What do phloem tubes transport? | Dissolved sugars (e.g., sucrose) and amino acids in all directions.
Are xylem cells living or dead? | Dead cells.
Are phloem cells living or dead? | Living cells.
What is lignin? | A woody material that strengthens xylem cell walls, making them strong, waterproof and stiff.
What is the structure of xylem vessels? | Dead cells joined end to end with no end walls, forming a hollow tube (lumen).
What are sieve-tube elements? | Columns of living cells in phloem joined end to end.
What are sieve plates? | End-plates with holes in phloem that allow sugars and amino acids to flow through.
What are companion cells? | Cells that support sieve tube elements and carry out living functions for them.
Why do sieve tube elements need companion cells? | Because they contain no nucleus and can't survive on their own.
In what direction does water move in xylem? | One-way from roots to leaves.
In what direction do substances move in phloem? | In all directions (up and down).
What is a potometer? | Apparatus used to investigate the effect of environmental conditions on transpiration rate.
What are the two types of potometer? | Mass potometer and bubble potometer.
What does a mass potometer measure? | The change in mass of a plant as water evaporates.
What does a bubble potometer measure? | The uptake of water by a stem (as water is lost by evaporation).
How do you calculate transpiration rate using a bubble potometer? | Distance moved by bubble ÷ time.
Why should the shoot be cut underwater when setting up a potometer? | To prevent air entering the xylem.
Why should leaves be dried before starting the experiment? | Because wet leaves will affect results.
What does it mean if the bubble travels further in the same time? | The rate of transpiration is greater.
