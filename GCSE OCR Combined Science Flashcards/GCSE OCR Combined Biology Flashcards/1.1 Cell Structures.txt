What are the two main types of organisms based on cell structure? | Eukaryotes and prokaryotes
What is the main difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells? | Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus containing DNA; prokaryotic cells have DNA floating free in the cytoplasm
What is the typical size of a prokaryotic cell? | Approximately 1 µm
What is the function of the cytoplasm? | Gel-like substance where most chemical reactions take place
What is the function of the cell membrane? | Controls what enters and leaves the cell; acts as a selective barrier
What is the function of the cell wall in prokaryotes? | Provides strength and maintains cell shape
What shape is the DNA in prokaryotic cells? | One long circular chromosome
What are plasmids? | Small loops of extra DNA in bacteria that can provide benefits like antibiotic resistance
What is the function of the nucleus? | Contains genetic material (DNA) that controls cell activities
What is the function of mitochondria? | Site of aerobic respiration; releases energy from food
Why do cells with high metabolism have more mitochondria? | They carry out many reactions and need more energy
What structures are found in plant cells but not animal cells? | Cell wall, chloroplasts, and vacuole
What is the cell wall made of in plant cells? | Cellulose
What is the function of chloroplasts? | Site of photosynthesis; contains chlorophyll to absorb light energy
What is chlorophyll? | Green pigment in chloroplasts that absorbs light energy for photosynthesis
What is the function of ribosomes? | Site of protein synthesis
What is the function of the vacuole in plant cells? | Contains cell sap, stores materials, and helps support cell shape
What stain is commonly used for cheek cells? | Methylene blue
What stain is commonly used for onion cells? | Iodine
Why must specimens be very thin for light microscopy? | To allow light to pass through so structures can be seen clearly
Why should you wear gloves when preparing slides? | To prevent cross-contamination with foreign cells
Why is a coverslip pressed down gently? | To remove air bubbles
What can prevent dehydration of tissue samples on slides? | Adding a drop of water beneath the coverslip
Which objective lens should you start with when viewing a specimen? | Low power objective lens
Why start with the low power objective lens? | Easier to find what you're looking for and prevents damage to lens or coverslip
What is a graticule? | A small disc with an engraved scale placed in the eyepiece to measure cells
What is a stage micrometer? | A microscope slide with an engraved scale used to calibrate the graticule
Why must a graticule be calibrated? | It has no fixed units, so it must be calibrated for each objective lens
Why may cell sizes appear inconsistent on different slides? | Cells are 3D but cut at different planes, appearing different on 2D slides
What is the formula for magnification? | Magnification = Image size ÷ Actual size
How do you calculate actual size from magnification? | Actual size = Image size ÷ Magnification
How do you calculate image size from magnification? | Image size = Actual size × Magnification
Does magnification have units? | No, it is written as 'X 10' or 'X 5000'
How do you convert mm to µm? | Multiply by 1000 (1 mm = 1000 µm)
How do you convert µm to mm? | Divide by 1000
How do you convert µm to nm? | Multiply by 1000 (1 µm = 1000 nm)
What is standard form? | A way of writing very large or small numbers using powers of 10 (a × 10ⁿ)
In standard form, what must 'a' be? | Between 1 and 10 (1 ≤ a < 10)
How do you calculate total magnification of a light microscope? | Eyepiece lens magnification × Objective lens magnification
What do electron microscopes use instead of light? | Beams of electrons
Why do electron microscopes have higher resolution than light microscopes? | Electron beams have much smaller wavelengths than visible light
What is the maximum magnification of a TEM? | Approximately 50,000,000× (50 million times)
What structures has the electron microscope helped scientists understand better? | Internal structure of mitochondria, nucleus, and cell membrane
What are three disadvantages of electron microscopes? | Very expensive, not portable, complicated sample preparation
What is the maximum magnification of a light microscope? | Up to 2000×
What is the resolution of a light microscope? | 200 nm
What is the resolution of an electron microscope? | 0.5 nm
Can light microscopes view living specimens? | Yes
Can electron microscopes view living specimens? | No, specimens must be dead
Do electron microscopes require a vacuum? | Yes
Do light microscopes require a vacuum? | No
Are electron microscope images in colour? | No, they are black and white (false colour can be added later)
What type of microscope would you use to see the internal structure of a chloroplast? | Electron microscope (TEM)
What type of microscope is small and easy to carry? | Light microscope
What must you always check when doing magnification calculations? | That both measurements are in the same units
If a cell image is 30 mm and magnification is ×3000, what is the actual size in µm? | 10 µm (30 ÷ 3000 = 0.01 mm = 10 µm)
