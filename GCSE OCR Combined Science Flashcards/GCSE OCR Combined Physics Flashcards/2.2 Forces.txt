What is the definition of a force? | A push or a pull that acts on an object due to the interaction with another object
What are the three main effects forces can have on objects? | They can change their speed, direction, or shape
What is weight? | The name given to the force of gravity on a mass
What is thrust? | The force causing an object to move (such as the force from a rocket engine)
What is air resistance (or drag)? | The friction of the air on a moving object
What is upthrust? | The force of a fluid (such as water) pushing an object upwards (making it float)
What is compression? | Forces that act inward on an object, squeezing it
What is tension? | Force transmitted through a cable or a string when pulled on by forces acting on its opposite ends
What is a reaction force (or normal force)? | A force due to contact between two objects
What are the two main categories of forces? | Contact forces and non-contact forces
What is a contact force? | A force which acts between objects that are physically touching
Give four examples of contact forces. | Friction, air resistance, tension, and reaction force/normal force
What does friction do? | It opposes motion and occurs when objects rub against each other
What is a non-contact force? | A force which acts at a distance, without any contact between bodies, due to the action of a field
Give three examples of non-contact forces. | Gravitational force, electrostatic force, and magnetic force
What is gravitational attraction? | The attractive force experienced by two objects with mass
What is electrostatic force? | A force experienced by charged objects which can be attractive or repulsive
What is magnetic force? | A force experienced between magnetic poles that can be attractive or repulsive
What is a force pair? | When there is an interaction between two objects, a force is exerted on each object
What law describes force pairs? | Newton's Third Law
How can force pairs be represented? | By arrows in vector diagrams
How do you calculate net (resultant) force when forces act in opposite directions? | Subtract them from each other
How do you calculate net force when forces act in the same direction? | Add them together
What does it mean when forces are balanced? | Forces acting in opposite directions are equal in size, resulting in no resultant force
What does the size of an arrow in a vector diagram represent? | The magnitude (size) of the force
What is a free body diagram used for? | To model the forces acting on an object
What three characteristics should each vector arrow in a free body diagram have? | Scaled to the magnitude of the force, points in the direction the force acts, and is labelled with the name of the force
What can free body diagrams be used to identify? | Which forces act in which plane and to resolve the net force in a particular direction
What does "resolving" a force mean? | Splitting a force vector into two components
What are the two components a force can be split into? | A horizontal component and a vertical component
What angle are horizontal and vertical components always at to each other? | Right angles (90°)
What does equilibrium mean in terms of forces? | When all the forces are balanced and there is no resultant force
What happens to an object in equilibrium? | It will remain at rest or at constant velocity, and will not rotate or move
When three forces act on a body in equilibrium, what shape do they form when added together? | A closed vector triangle
What does a closed vector triangle indicate? | The resultant force on the body is zero
Why does an object moving in a circular path have a changing velocity? | Because velocity is a vector quantity and although speed may be constant, the direction of travel is always changing
What is true about the speed and velocity of an object in circular motion? | It travels at a constant speed but has a changing velocity
Are objects in circular motion accelerating? | Yes, because their velocity (direction) is constantly changing
What is the speed of the International Space Station? | About 7660 m/s
