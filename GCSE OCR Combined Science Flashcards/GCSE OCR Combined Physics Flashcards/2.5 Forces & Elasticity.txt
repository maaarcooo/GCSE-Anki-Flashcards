What three ways can forces change the shape of stationary objects? | Stretching, bending, and compressing
What is compression? | Forces in opposite directions acting towards an object
What is stretching? | Forces in opposite directions acting away from an object
What is bending? | Forces acting towards each other but at different points on an object, or forces at an angle to each other
How many forces are needed to change the shape of a stationary object? | More than one force
What is elastic deformation? | When objects return to their original shape after the stretching force is removed
What is plastic deformation? | When objects remain stretched and do not return to their original shape after the force is removed
Give three examples of materials that undergo elastic deformation. | Rubber bands, fabrics, steel springs
Give three examples of materials that undergo plastic deformation. | Plastic, clay, glass
What does Hooke's Law state? | The extension of an elastic object is directly proportional to the force applied, up to the limit of proportionality
What is the limit of proportionality? | The point beyond which force and extension are no longer directly proportional
What is the equation for Hooke's Law? | F = k × x (Force = spring constant × extension)
What are the units for force in Hooke's Law? | Newtons (N)
What are the units for spring constant? | Newtons per metre (N/m)
What are the units for extension in Hooke's Law? | Metres (m)
What does the spring constant represent? | How stiff the spring is
How does spring constant relate to stiffness? | The higher the spring constant, the higher the stiffness
How do you calculate extension? | Final length − Original length
What does a linear region on a force-extension graph indicate? | Force is proportional to extension and the spring obeys Hooke's Law
What does a non-linear region on a force-extension graph indicate? | Force and extension are no longer directly proportional (beyond limit of proportionality)
What is the spring constant equal to on a force-extension graph? | The gradient of the linear part of the graph
What happens when work is done on a spring? | Energy is transferred to its elastic potential energy store
What is elastic potential energy? | The energy stored in an elastic object when work is done on the object
What is the equation for elastic potential energy? | Eₑ = ½ × k × e²
What are the units for elastic potential energy? | Joules (J)
When are work done and elastic potential energy equal? | When the spring has not exceeded its limit of proportionality
If extension is doubled, what happens to work done? | It is quadrupled (×4)
What is the purpose of investigating force and extension? | To investigate the relationship between force and extension for a spring
What is the independent variable in the force-extension experiment? | Force (F)
What is the dependent variable in the force-extension experiment? | Extension (x)
What equipment is needed to investigate Hooke's Law? | Clamp and stand, ruler, spring, masses (5 × 100g), mass hanger, pointer/fiducial marker
What is the resolution of the ruler? | 1 mm
How do you calculate the force applied by a mass? | F = mg (mass × gravitational field strength)
What value is used for gravitational field strength in calculations? | 10 N/kg
What does a straight line through the origin on a force-extension graph show? | The force is proportional to extension
What is parallax error? | Error caused by not reading measurements at eye level
What is a fiducial marker? | A pointer used to measure extension more accurately
Why should you wait after adding a mass? | To allow the spring to fully extend before taking the reading
What safety equipment should be worn during the experiment? | Goggles (in case the spring snaps)
Why place a mat below the masses? | To prevent damage if the masses fall
Why use a G clamp? | To secure the clamp stand to the desk so it doesn't fall over
What does "proportional" mean mathematically? | A straight line going through the origin
What does "linear" mean mathematically? | A straight line (but not necessarily through the origin)
What does "non-linear" mean? | A graph that is not a straight line (curved)
What should you check to ensure Hooke's Law applies? | That the spring has not gone past its limit of proportionality
Why repeat the experiment three times? | To calculate an average length and improve reliability
What common mistake is made when calculating extension? | Calculating the increase in length each time instead of total extension from original length
