What is mass? | The measure of the amount of matter in an object. It is measured in kilograms (kg) and is a scalar quantity.
What is weight? | The force acting on an object due to gravitational attraction. It is measured in Newtons (N) and is a vector quantity.
What is the equation for weight? | Weight = mass × gravitational field strength (W = m × g)
What is the SI unit for mass? | Kilogram (kg)
What is the SI unit for weight? | Newton (N)
Is mass a scalar or vector quantity? | Scalar quantity
Is weight a scalar or vector quantity? | Vector quantity
How do you convert grams to kilograms? | Divide by 1000
What property of an object resists change in motion? | Mass
What happens to an object's mass on different planets? | Mass always remains the same regardless of location.
What happens to an object's weight on different planets? | Weight changes depending on the gravitational field strength of the planet.
What is the gravitational field strength on Earth? | 9.81 N/kg (or 9.81 m/s²)
What is the gravitational field strength on the Moon? | 1.63 N/kg
How many times less would an object weigh on the Moon compared to Earth? | About 6 times less
What is free fall? | When an object is falling solely under the influence of gravity.
What is the acceleration of free-falling objects on Earth? | 9.81 m/s²
In the absence of air resistance, how do different masses fall near Earth? | All bodies fall with the same acceleration regardless of their mass.
What three phenomena are caused by weight? | Objects stay firmly on the ground, objects fall to the ground, and satellites are kept in orbit.
How can you measure and compare the weight of two objects? | Using a balance
Does gravitational field strength vary between planets? | Yes, it depends on the planet's mass and radius.
What causes planets to attract nearby masses with strong gravitational force? | Planets have strong gravitational fields.
Why do satellites stay in orbit? | Due to the gravitational attraction (weight force) between the satellite and the planet.
