What is the prefix for 10³? | Kilo- (k)
What is the prefix for 10⁻²? | Centi- (c)
What is the prefix for 10⁻³? | Milli- (m)
What is the prefix for 10⁻⁶? | Micro- (μ)

What is a scalar quantity? | A quantity with only magnitude (size) but no direction
What is a vector quantity? | A quantity with both magnitude and direction
Is distance a scalar or vector? | Scalar
Is displacement a scalar or vector? | Vector
Is speed a scalar or vector? | Scalar
Is velocity a scalar or vector? | Vector
Is mass a scalar or vector? | Scalar
Is force a vector or scalar? | Vector
What is the difference between distance and displacement? | Distance = how far travelled; displacement = distance from start with direction
What is the difference between speed and velocity? | Speed has magnitude only; velocity has magnitude and direction
What does a straight line on a velocity-time graph represent? | Constant acceleration
What does a steep slope on a velocity-time graph mean? | Large acceleration (speed changing quickly)
What does a gentle slope on a velocity-time graph mean? | Small acceleration (speed changing gradually)
What does a flat horizontal line on a velocity-time graph mean? | Zero acceleration (constant velocity)
How do you calculate acceleration from a velocity-time graph? | Find the gradient: acceleration = rise ÷ run
What does the area under a velocity-time graph represent? (Higher Tier) | The distance travelled (or displacement)
How do you find distance from a velocity-time graph? (Higher Tier) | Calculate the area under the line (use triangle and rectangle formulas)
What is the formula for the area of a triangle? | Area = ½ × base × height
What is the formula for the area of a rectangle? | Area = base × height
What is acceleration? | The rate of change of velocity
What is the equation for acceleration? | a = Δv ÷ t or a = (v - u) ÷ t
What units are used for acceleration? | metres per second squared (m/s²)
What does positive acceleration mean? | The object is speeding up
What does negative acceleration mean? | The object is slowing down (decelerating)
What does u represent in motion equations? | Initial velocity (starting speed)
What does v represent in motion equations? | Final velocity (ending speed)
What is the equation for uniform acceleration? (Higher Tier) | v² - u² = 2 × a × x
When do you use the equation v² - u² = 2ax? (Higher Tier) | When time is not known but you need to find speed, acceleration or distance
What is kinetic energy? | The energy an object has due to its mass and speed
What is the equation for kinetic energy? | Eₖ = ½ × m × v²
What units are used for kinetic energy? | Joules (J)
How does acceleration affect kinetic energy? | Acceleration changes speed, which changes kinetic energy
What happens to kinetic energy if speed doubles? | Kinetic energy increases by a factor of 4 (since v is squared)
What is non-uniform motion? | Motion where speed or direction is changing
What is the equation for average speed with non-uniform motion? | Average speed = total distance ÷ time taken
When describing an experiment to measure speed, what should you write first? | The equation you'll use (it hints at variables to measure)
How do you draw a gradient triangle on a graph? | Draw a large right-angled triangle using the line, marking the rise (Δy) and run (Δx)
