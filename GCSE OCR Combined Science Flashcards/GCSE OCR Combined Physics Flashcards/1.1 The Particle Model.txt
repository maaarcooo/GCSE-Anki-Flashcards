What is the Greek word for 'indivisible' that led to the term 'atom'? | Atomos
What did early Greek philosophers like Democritus believe about the smallest piece of matter? | It would be indivisible and could not be cut any further
What did JJ Thompson discover at the end of the 19th century? | The electron
Describe the Plum Pudding model of the atom. | Negatively charged electrons (plums) embedded in a positively charged 'dough' or 'pudding'
What particles did Rutherford's group fire at the gold foil in the alpha scattering experiment? | Alpha particles (He²⁺ ions)
What were the three main observations from Rutherford's alpha scattering experiment? | Most alpha particles passed straight through, some changed direction, and a few bounced back
What did the fact that most alpha particles passed straight through the gold foil indicate? | Atoms are mostly empty space
What did the deflection of some alpha particles indicate about the nucleus? | The nucleus has a strong positive charge
What did the bouncing back of alpha particles indicate? | The atom contains a small, heavy nucleus
What model replaced the Plum Pudding model? | The nuclear model
In Rutherford's nuclear model, where is nearly all the mass of the atom concentrated? | In the centre (the nucleus)
What charge does the nucleus have in the nuclear model? | Positive charge
Who developed the Bohr model of the atom and when? | Niels Bohr in 1913
What are the different orbit distances in the Bohr model called? | Energy levels
How many electrons can orbit in the first energy level? | Up to 2 electrons
How many electrons can orbit in the second and third energy levels? | Up to 8 electrons each
Why did the Bohr model become the accepted model? | It explained experimental findings better than the nuclear model, explained absorption and emission of electromagnetic radiation, and theoretical calculations agreed with experimental results
What three subatomic particles make up an atom? | Protons, neutrons, and electrons
Where are protons and neutrons located in the atom? | In the nucleus
What is the charge of a proton? | Positive
What is the charge of a neutron? | No charge (neutral)
What is the charge of an electron? | Negative
What is the relative mass of a proton? | 1 atomic mass unit
What is the relative mass of an electron compared to a proton? | 1/2000 the mass of a proton
What is the radius of an atom? | 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m
How many times smaller is the nucleus radius compared to the whole atom? | Over 10,000 times smaller
Define density. | The mass per unit volume of a material
Write the equation for density. | ρ = m/V (where ρ = density, m = mass, V = volume)
What are the SI units for density? | kg/m³
What are alternative units for density commonly used? | g/cm³
Why are gases less dense than solids? | The molecules are more spread out (same mass over a larger volume)
What is the approximate density of water? | 1000 kg/m³
What is the approximate density of air at room temperature? | 1.3 kg/m³
How does the density of a gas typically compare to a solid or liquid? | About one-thousandth (1/1000) of the density
Why are solids and liquids roughly the same density? | The molecules are tightly packed together in both states
At room temperature, how much greater is the distance between gas molecules compared to solid/liquid molecules? | About ten times (in each direction)
What is the formula for the volume of a cube? | V = d³ (where d = length of side)
What is the formula for the volume of a sphere? | V = (4/3)πr³ (where r = radius)
What is the formula for the volume of a cylinder? | V = πr²l (where r = radius, l = length)
How do you convert from centimetres to metres? | Divide by 100 (or multiply by 0.01)
How do you convert from grams to kilograms? | Divide by 1000 (or multiply by 0.001)
In the density experiment for regular objects, what equipment measures mass? | Digital balance
What three measuring instruments can be used to measure dimensions in the density experiment? | 30 cm ruler, Vernier calipers, or micrometer
What is the resolution of a 30 cm ruler? | 1 mm
What is the resolution of Vernier calipers? | 0.01 mm
What is the resolution of a micrometer? | 0.001 mm
What equipment is used to measure the volume of irregular objects? | Displacement 'Eureka' can and measuring cylinder
How do you find the volume of an irregular object using displacement? | The volume of water displaced equals the volume of the object
In the liquid density experiment, how do you find the mass of just the liquid? | Mass of cylinder with water minus mass of empty cylinder
Why should you take repeat readings in density experiments? | To calculate an average and minimise random errors
What systematic error should you avoid when measuring mass? | Ensure the digital balance is set to zero before taking measurements
Why should you place an irregular object carefully into the displacement can? | Dropping it might cause water to splash, leading to an incorrect volume reading
What safety consideration is important when using a measuring cylinder on a balance? | Do not pour water into the cylinder when it's on the electric balance (risk of electric shock)
