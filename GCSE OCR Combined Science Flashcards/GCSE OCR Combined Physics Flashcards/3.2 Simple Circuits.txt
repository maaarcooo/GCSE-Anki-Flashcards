What does a switch do in a circuit? | Turns the circuit on (closed) or off (open)
What is a fixed resistor? | A resistor that limits current flow with a resistance that cannot change
How does a thermistor's resistance change with temperature? | As temperature increases, resistance decreases (and vice versa)
How does an LDR's resistance change with light? | As light intensity increases, resistance decreases (and vice versa)
What does a diode do? | Allows current to flow in one direction only
How must an ammeter be connected in a circuit? | In series with other components
How must a voltmeter be connected in a circuit? | In parallel with the component being measured
What is potential difference? | The amount of energy transferred per unit of charge passing through the terminals
What is 1 volt equivalent to? | 1 joule per coulomb (1 V = 1 J/C)
What is resistance? | The opposition to current in a circuit
What is the unit of resistance? | Ohms (Ω)
What is the relationship between resistance and current? | Higher resistance means lower current (and vice versa)
What is the equation linking voltage, current and resistance? | V = IR (Voltage = Current × Resistance)
Are current and potential difference directly proportional? | Yes - when there is more current, it has more potential difference
What are the two types of resistors? | Fixed resistors and variable resistors
How can a variable resistor change its resistance? | By changing the length of wire in the circuit using a slider
Does a longer wire have more or less resistance? | More resistance than a shorter wire
What happens to a thermistor's resistance when it gets hotter? | Its resistance decreases
What happens to a thermistor's resistance when it gets cooler? | Its resistance increases
Where are thermistors used? | Ovens, fire alarms, digital thermometers
What is an LDR's resistance in the dark? | Very large (millions of ohms)
What is an LDR's resistance in bright light? | Small (tens of ohms)
Where are LDRs used? | Automatic street lights and garden lights that switch on when dark
What does a linear I-V graph look like? | A straight line
What does a non-linear I-V graph look like? | A curve (not a straight line)
Do linear components obey Ohm's Law? | Yes - they have constant resistance
Which components have linear I-V characteristics? | Fixed resistors, wires, heating elements
Which components have non-linear I-V characteristics? | Filament lamps, diodes, LEDs, LDRs, thermistors
What does the I-V graph for a fixed resistor show? | A straight line through the origin - current is directly proportional to potential difference
Why is a fixed resistor's I-V graph a straight line? | Because its resistance is constant
What does the I-V graph for a filament lamp look like? | A curve - current increases at a proportionally slower rate than potential difference
Why does a filament lamp's I-V graph curve? | As current increases, temperature increases, causing atoms to vibrate more and resistance to increase
What is forward bias in a diode? | When current flows in the direction of the arrowhead symbol
What is reverse bias in a diode? | When the diode is switched around - it has very high resistance and no current flows
What does the I-V graph for a diode show? | Sharp increase in current and voltage on one side (forward bias), zero on the other side (reverse bias)
What is the aim of the I-V characteristics experiment? | To investigate the I-V characteristics of a fixed resistor, lamp and diode
What is the independent variable in the I-V experiment? | Potential difference (V)
What is the dependent variable in the I-V experiment? | Current (I)
How do you vary the voltage across a component in the experiment? | By changing the resistance of the variable resistor
Why should you switch off the circuit between readings? | To prevent heating of the component and wires
How do you get negative voltage readings? | Reverse the terminals of the power supply
What type of conductor has an I-V graph that is a straight line? | An ohmic conductor (e.g. fixed resistor)
What type of conductor has an I-V graph that is a curve? | A non-ohmic conductor (e.g. filament lamp, diode)
What safety precaution is needed with high current and thin wires? | Never touch the wire directly when the circuit is on - it becomes very hot
Why should components be disconnected between readings? | To avoid components heating up too much
What provides a circuit with potential difference? | A cell or battery (energy source)
What makes one end of a circuit positive and the other negative? | The terminals of a cell
What direction does current flow? | From positive to negative terminal of the power supply
What must a complete circuit have for current to flow? | A closed path (complete loop) - electrons need to flow in a complete loop
What is another name for potential difference? | Voltage
What symbol means light-dependent on a circuit diagram? | Two arrows pointing towards the symbol
What symbol means light-emitting on a circuit diagram? | Two arrows pointing away from the symbol
What do good conductors have? | Low resistance
What do insulators have? | High resistance
How can you increase the resistance of a circuit? | By adding resistors or variable resistors
Where the I-V graph is a straight line, what can you say about resistance? | The resistance is constant
What happens to resistance where an I-V graph curves? | The resistance increases as the graph curves
