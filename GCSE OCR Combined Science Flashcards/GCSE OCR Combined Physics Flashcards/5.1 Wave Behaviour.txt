What is amplitude? | The distance from the undisturbed position to the peak or trough of a wave, measured in metres (m), symbol A.
What is wavelength? | The distance from one point on a wave to the same point on the next wave, measured in metres (m), symbol λ.
How do you measure wavelength in a transverse wave? | From one peak to the next peak.
How do you measure wavelength in a longitudinal wave? | From the centre of one compression to the centre of the next compression.
What is frequency? | The number of waves passing a point in one second, measured in Hertz (Hz), symbol f.
What is the time period of a wave? | The time taken for a single wave to pass a point (or one complete cycle), measured in seconds (s), symbol T.
What is the relationship between frequency and time period? | f = 1/T (frequency equals one divided by time period).
What is wave speed? | The distance travelled by a wave each second, measured in metres per second (m/s), symbol v.
What is the wave equation? | v = fλ (wave speed = frequency × wavelength).
What are transverse waves? | Waves where the direction of energy transfer is perpendicular (at 90°) to the direction of travel.
What are the highest and lowest points on a transverse wave called? | Highest = peak or crest; Lowest = trough.
Can mechanical transverse waves travel through gases? | No, they can travel through solids or on the surface of liquids, but not through liquids or gases.
Give three examples of transverse waves. | Ripples on water, electromagnetic waves (light, radio, X-rays), S-waves (seismic waves).
What are longitudinal waves? | Waves where the points vibrate parallel to the direction of energy transfer.
What are the key features of longitudinal waves? | Compressions (points close together) and rarefactions (points spaced apart).
Can longitudinal waves travel through a vacuum? | No, they require particles to travel, so cannot move through a vacuum.
Give two examples of longitudinal waves. | Sound waves and P-waves (seismic waves).
Do waves transfer matter? | No, waves transfer energy but not matter.
How do floating objects demonstrate waves don't transfer matter? | They bob up and down but don't travel with the wave, showing only energy moves, not the water itself.
What is one method to measure the speed of sound using two people? | Stand 100 m apart, one person bangs blocks, the other times from seeing the blocks to hearing the sound, then calculate speed = distance ÷ time.
How can echoes be used to measure the speed of sound? | Stand 50 m from a wall, clap in rhythm with echoes, time 20 claps, distance = 2 × 50 × 20, then calculate speed = distance ÷ time.
How can an oscilloscope measure the speed of sound? | Place two microphones 5 m apart, make a sound at the first, measure time difference between microphones detecting it, calculate speed = distance ÷ time.
What equipment is needed for a ripple tank experiment? | Ripple tank with water, wooden bar, light source, ruler, stopwatch, screen, strobe light (optional).
How do you measure wavelength in a ripple tank? | Measure the length of the screen and divide by the number of wavefronts visible.
How do you measure frequency in a ripple tank? | Time how long it takes for a given number of waves to pass a point, then divide number of waves by time.
How can you improve wavelength measurement accuracy? | Measure across multiple waves (e.g. 5) and divide the total distance by the number of waves.
How can you improve frequency measurement accuracy? | Measure over a longer time period (e.g. one minute) and divide the number of waves by the time.
What is a strobe light used for in wave experiments? | To make waves appear stationary by flashing at the same frequency, making them easier to measure.
What safety precaution is important when using a ripple tank? | Be careful with water and electricity in close proximity to avoid electric shock; stand up to react quickly to spills.
What is the speed of sound approximately? | Around 330 m/s in air (varies with temperature).
If a wave has frequency 2 Hz and wavelength 3 m, what is its speed? | v = fλ = 2 × 3 = 6 m/s.
If wave speed is 15 m/s and frequency is 5 Hz, what is the wavelength? | λ = v ÷ f = 15 ÷ 5 = 3 m.
If wave speed is 20 m/s and wavelength is 4 m, what is the frequency? | f = v ÷ λ = 20 ÷ 4 = 5 Hz.
What does 1 kHz equal? | 1000 Hz.
Why is Method 1 (two people with blocks) the least accurate for measuring sound speed? | The time interval is very short and reaction time (up to 0.2 s) significantly affects results.
Why is the oscilloscope method most accurate for measuring sound speed? | Timing is done automatically, eliminating human reaction time errors.
What happens to wavelength if frequency increases but wave speed stays constant? | Wavelength decreases (since v = fλ, if f increases and v is constant, λ must decrease).
What is the undisturbed position of a wave? | The central line where there is no displacement; the rest position of the medium.
In what direction do particles move in a transverse wave? | Perpendicular (at 90°) to the direction of energy transfer.
In what direction do particles move in a longitudinal wave? | Parallel to the direction of energy transfer.
Can electromagnetic waves travel through a vacuum? | Yes, electromagnetic waves (like light) can travel through solids, liquids, gases, and a vacuum.
What property changes in a longitudinal wave: density or pressure? | Both - there are changes in density (compressions/rarefactions) and changes in pressure.
What property stays constant in a transverse wave: density or pressure? | Both density and pressure remain constant in transverse waves.
