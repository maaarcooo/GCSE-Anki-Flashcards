What is the radius of an atom? | About 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ metres
What particles are found in the nucleus? | Protons and neutrons only
What is the charge of the nucleus? | Positive (because protons are positive and neutrons are neutral)
What determines which element an atom is? | The number of protons in the nucleus
How does the radius of the nucleus compare to the atom? | The nucleus radius is about 10,000 times smaller than the atom
Where is virtually all the atom's mass concentrated? | Inside the nucleus
What are energy levels? | Particular distances from the nucleus where electrons orbit
What happens when an electron moves from a lower to higher energy level? | It absorbs electromagnetic radiation (excitation)
What happens when an electron moves from a higher to lower energy level? | It emits electromagnetic radiation (de-excitation)
What is ionisation? | When an atom gains or loses an electron from the outer energy level
What is an ion? | An atom or particle with a non-zero charge
How are positive ions formed? | When electrons are knocked out from an atom
How are negative ions formed? | When the outer shell of an atom gains an electron
What happens when electrons absorb electromagnetic radiation? | They move to a higher energy level
Why do dark coloured objects appear dark? | They are good absorbers of radiation and do not reflect the energy that hits them
What happens to an electron after it has moved up an energy level? | It becomes unstable and eventually moves back down, emitting electromagnetic radiation
How are colours in the visible spectrum produced? | From electrons moving down energy levels and emitting electromagnetic radiation

What is the relative mass of an electron? | 1/2000 (Negligible)
What is the relative charge of an electron? | -1
Why is the total charge within an atom zero? | The number of electrons equals the number of protons
What is the atomic number? | The number of protons in an atom (also called proton number)
What does the atomic number equal in a neutral atom? | The number of electrons
What is the mass number? | The total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus
How do you calculate the number of neutrons? | Mass number - Atomic number
In nuclear notation, where is the mass number written? | Top number (above the element symbol)
In nuclear notation, where is the atomic number written? | Lower number (below the element symbol)
What are isotopes? | Atoms of the same element with equal protons but different numbers of neutrons
Do isotopes have different chemical properties? | No, only different masses
Why do some isotopes appear unstable? | They have an imbalance of protons and neutrons
How many protons and electrons do different isotopes of the same element have? | The same number
Why are some atomic nuclei unstable? | Due to an imbalance in the forces within the nucleus
What is radioactive decay? | The process of unstable nuclei emitting radiation to become more stable
Is radioactive decay predictable? | No, it is a random process
What types of nuclear radiation can be emitted? | Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Neutrons
What is an alpha particle? | A helium nucleus consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons
What is the charge of an alpha particle? | +2
What is a beta particle? | A fast-moving electron
How is a beta particle produced? | When a neutron changes into a proton and an electron in the nucleus
What is the charge of a beta particle? | -1
What are gamma rays? | Electromagnetic waves with the highest energy
What is the charge of gamma rays? | No charge (0)
What is activity? | The rate at which unstable nuclei from a source of radiation decay
What is the unit of activity? | Becquerels (Bq)
What does 1 Becquerel mean? | 1 nucleus decaying per second
What device is commonly used to detect radiation? | Geiger-Muller tube (connected to a Geiger counter)
What is count-rate? | The number of decays recorded each second by a detector
In alpha decay, how does the mass number change? | Decreases by 4
In alpha decay, how does the atomic number change? | Decreases by 2
In beta minus decay, how does the mass number change? | Stays the same
In beta minus decay, how does the atomic number change? | Increases by 1
In gamma decay, how does the mass number change? | Stays the same
In gamma decay, how does the atomic number change? | Stays the same
What is the parent nucleus? | The nucleus that decays
What is the daughter nucleus? | The nucleus remaining after decay
Must nuclear equations balance? | Yes, both mass numbers and atomic numbers must balance on left and right
Which type of radiation has the shortest range in air? | Alpha (few centimetres)
What is the range of beta in air? | Few tens of centimetres
What is the range of gamma in air? | Infinite (not absorbed by air)
What material stops alpha radiation? | Paper
What material stops beta radiation? | Few millimetres of aluminium
What reduces gamma radiation? | Few millimetres of lead (only partially stops it)
Which type of radiation is most ionising? | Alpha
Which type of radiation is least ionising? | Gamma
What is the penetrating power trend from alpha to gamma? | Penetrating power increases (alpha least, gamma most)
What is the ionisation trend from alpha to gamma? | Ionisation decreases (alpha most, gamma least)
What is half-life? | The time it takes for the number of nuclei of a radioactive isotope to decrease by half
Can half-life also refer to activity? | Yes, the time for activity to fall to half its original level
Do different isotopes have different half-lives? | Yes, they vary from fractions of a second to billions of years
Is half-life constant for a particular isotope? | Yes
What is the half-life of Carbon-14? | 5,700 years
After one half-life, what percentage of original material remains? | 50%
After two half-lives, what percentage of original material remains? | 25%
After three half-lives, what percentage of original material remains? | 12.5%
How do you calculate the number of half-lives that have passed? | Divide the time period by the length of one half-life
If a sample goes from 2 million atoms to 500,000 atoms, how many half-lives occurred? | 2 half-lives
