What are the two main options to connect devices to a network? | Wired and Wireless
What is a wired network? | A network where physical cables are used to join devices together and transmit data
What is the most common type of cable in a local area network (LAN)? | Ethernet
What is Ethernet? | A wired networking standard that uses twisted pair cables to carry electrical signals between devices
Name three advantages of wired networks | Fast data transfer speeds, better physical security, and high range (up to 100m)
Name three disadvantages of wired networks | Limited portability, higher cost to add new devices, and safety hazards from cables
What is a wireless network? | A network where connections are made using radio waves to transmit data through the air
What are the two most common types of wireless connections? | Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
What does Wi-Fi stand for? | Wireless fidelity
What is a wireless access point (WAP)? | A device that allows wireless devices to connect to a network, can be standalone or built into a router or switch
Name three advantages of Wi-Fi | Easy portability, less expensive setup, and compatibility with most devices
Name three disadvantages of Wi-Fi | Slower data transfer than Ethernet, less secure than Ethernet, and limited range (up to 90m)
What is Bluetooth typically used for? | Direct connections between two devices, like headphones, controllers, keyboards, and mice
Name two advantages of Bluetooth | Compatibility with personal devices for ad-hoc connections and very low power consumption
Name three disadvantages of Bluetooth | Very slow transfer speeds, data can be intercepted by anyone in range, and very short range (10m)
What is encryption? | A method of scrambling data before transmission across a network to protect the contents from unauthorized access
Why is encryption more critical on wireless networks than wired networks? | Because wireless data is transmitted over radio waves, making it easier to intercept
What is an SSID? | Service Set Identifier - the name that identifies a wireless network
How is a master key created in wireless networks? | Using the SSID and password
What is cipher text? | Encrypted data that has been scrambled using the master key
What is plain text? | Normal, readable data before encryption or after decryption
Why is the master key never transmitted in a wireless network? | To guarantee security, as without it any intercepted data is useless
What protocol is specifically designed for Wi-Fi security? | WPA2
How does encryption on a wired network differ from wireless? | On wired networks, it's often left to individual applications (like HTTPS) to decide how encryption is used
What are the two types of network address systems? | IP Address and MAC Address
What is an IP address? | A unique identifier given to devices which communicate over the Internet (WAN)
Are IP addresses static or dynamic? | Dynamic - they can change
What does IPv4 look like? | 4 blocks of denary numbers between 0-255, separated by full stops (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
How many bits is an IPv4 address? | 32 bits (4 bytes)
How many unique addresses can IPv4 provide? | Over 4 billion (2^32)
What does IPv6 look like? | 8 blocks of 4 hexadecimal digits, separated by colons
How many bits is an IPv6 address? | 128 bits (16 bytes)
What is a MAC address? | A unique identifier given to devices which communicate over a local area network (LAN)
Are MAC addresses static or dynamic? | Static - they never change
What contains a MAC address? | Any device that contains a Network Interface Card (NIC)
How is a MAC address represented? | 12 hexadecimal digits (48 bits), usually grouped in pairs
What do the first three pairs in a MAC address represent? | The manufacturer ID number (OUI)
What do the last three pairs in a MAC address represent? | The serial number of the network interface card (NIC)
What is a computing standard? | A set of guidelines that allows different hardware and software to work together (compatibility) and exchange data (interoperability)
What is HTML an example of? | A standard for creating websites that allows them to be viewed on the World Wide Web using web browsers
What is Ethernet an example of? | A standard for wired network cables that allows the network to function
What is USB an example of? | A standard that defines the physical connector used for connecting peripheral devices to computers
What is Wi-Fi an example of? | A standard that allows wireless devices to communicate on a local area network (LAN)
What is a protocol? | A set of rules that govern communication on a network
What does TCP/IP stand for? | Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
What is TCP responsible for? | Making sure communication between two routers is error-free
What is IP responsible for? | Making sure data is delivered to the right device on a wide area network (WAN)
What does HTTP stand for? | Hypertext Transfer Protocol
What is HTTP used for? | Communication between clients and servers for website viewing
How does HTTPS differ from HTTP? | HTTPS adds a layer of security by encrypting all data sent and received
When should HTTPS be used? | To protect sensitive information such as passwords, financial information, and personal data
What does FTP stand for? | File Transfer Protocol
What is FTP used for? | Sending and receiving files between computers
What advantages does FTP offer? | Greater efficiency and support for bulk transfers and large files, including resuming interrupted transfers
What does SMTP stand for? | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
What is SMTP used for? | Communication between an email sender and the email server, and between different email servers
What does POP stand for? | Post Office Protocol
What is POP used for? | Downloading emails to a device from an email server
What happens to emails on the server after using POP? | They are removed from the server once downloaded
What does IMAP stand for? | Internet Message Access Protocol
What is IMAP used for? | Downloading emails to a device from an email server
What happens to emails on the server after using IMAP? | A copy is retained on the mail server
Name two advantages of POP | Frees up storage space on email servers and faster on slow connections
Name two disadvantages of POP | Only access emails from the device they're downloaded to and emails are deleted on the server once downloaded
Name two advantages of IMAP | View and manage emails from any device with internet access and changes made on one device are synchronized on all connected devices
Name two disadvantages of IMAP | Server storage space can limit amount of retained emails and requires internet access to view emails
What is a layer in networking? | A sub-part of a more complex task
Why are networks divided into layers? | To reduce complexity and make each layer more manageable
How many layers does the TCP/IP protocol use? | 4 layers
What is the TCP/IP layer model also known as? | A stack
Name three advantages of using layers | Layers are self-contained making managing/repairing/upgrading easier, allow focus on specific parts without affecting other layers, and promote interoperability
