What are abiotic components? | Non-living environmental factors that influence ecosystems (e.g., climate, light exposure, soil type)
What is a biome? | A large, distinct region of Earth with similar climate, soil, plants and animals (alsoSSP known as a global-scale ecosystem)
What are biotic components? | Living organisms that interact with the environment and other organisms within an ecosystem
What characterizes the coniferous forest biome? | Located at high latitudes, characterized by conifer trees and a cold climate
What are consumers in an ecosystem? | Organisms that receive energy from consuming (eating) living organisms
What role do decomposers play in an ecosystem? | They break down organic material and release nutrients back into the ecosystem
Where is the desert biome located and what are its characteristics? | Located around 30° north and south of the equator, characterized by extremely low precipitation and extreme daily temperature fluctuations
What is an ecosystem? | A natural system where a community of plants and animals interact with each other and their physical environment
What is eutrophication? | Growth of algae in water due to excess nutrients, leading to oxygen depletion in an aquatic ecosystem
What is a food chain? | A linear relationship showing biotic interactions within an ecosystem, from producer to final consumer
What is a food web? | A representation of interactions between multiple producers and consumers within an ecosystem, shown through different food chains
Where is the Mediterranean biome located and what are its characteristics? | Located 40-45° north of the equator (and isolated spots south), characterized by mild, moist winters and hot, dry summers
What is nutrient cycling? | The transfer of nutrients through an ecosystem, from decay of organic material into production and energy of living organisms
What are producers in an ecosystem? | Organisms that convert energy from the environment (mainly sunlight) into sugars (glucose)
Where is the savanna biome located and what are its characteristics? | Located around 15-30° north and south of the equator, characterized by high temperatures, very dry summers and very wet winters
What characterizes the temperate deciduous forest biome? | Located around 40-50° north and south of the equator, characterized by deciduous trees (trees that shed leaves) and moderate precipitation
Where is the temperate grassland biome and what are its characteristics? | Located in non-coastal areas around 30-40° north and south of the equator, characterized by low precipitation and grasses as major vegetation
What are the characteristics of the tropical rainforest biome? | Located near the equator, characterized by very high precipitation and sustained warm temperatures
What characterizes the tundra biome? | Located in the far northern hemisphere, characterized by very cold conditions and permanently frozen soils
