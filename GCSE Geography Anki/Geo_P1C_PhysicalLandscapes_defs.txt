What is abrasion? | A form of erosion where loose material acts like sandpaper on river walls, cliffs, or glaciers
What is attrition? | When rocks bang against each other, chipping away to make smaller, smoother rocks
What is the backshore? | The upper beach closest to the land, including any cliffs or sand dunes
What is beach nourishment? | Adding sand to an eroding beach to protect cliffs or sand dunes from erosion
What is biological weathering? | When rocks are broken apart by vegetation, roots, or chemical reactions from animal waste
What is corrasion? | A form of mechanical erosion where sea material is flung at cliff-faces by waves, breaking up the rocks
What is chemical weathering? | When weak acid in rainwater dissolves chemical compounds in rock
What is a drainage basin? | The area of land drained by a river and its tributaries
What is dredging? | Digging up rubbish and sediment from the bottom of a river
What are embankments? | Built-up river banks made of brick and concrete to increase channel capacity
What is an estuary? | The point where a river meets the ocean, often muddy or silty
What is fetch? | The length of water over which wind has traveled
What is a floodplain? | The low-lying, wide floor of a river valley that acts as overspill when the channel is full
What is floodplain zoning? | Controlling where buildings are built relative to a river to reduce flood risk
What is freeze-thaw weathering? | Water freezes in rock cracks, expands, and enlarges the cracks, weakening the rock over time
What is geology? | The physical structure and arrangement of rock
What is a groyne? | A concrete or wooden wall built perpendicular to the seafront to trap sediment and reduce erosion
What is hard management? | Using concrete structures like groynes, sea walls, and rock armor to reduce coastal erosion
What are highlands? | Land at high elevation with larger relief (difference between highest and lowest points)
What is hydraulic action? | When compressed air forced into rock cracks causes the rock to weaken and break apart
What does impermeable mean? | Rock that does not allow water to pass through it
What is a levee? | The banks of a river
What is longshore drift? | Transportation of sediment along a beach, determined by the direction of prevailing wind
What are lowlands? | Flat land with small relief at low elevation
What is mass movement? | Large downhill movement of material (usually from cliff-face) caused by gravity
What is mechanical weathering? | Breakdown of rocks due to physical forces rather than chemical reactions
What does permeable mean? | Rock that allows water to pass through it
What is relief? | The difference in height between the lowest and highest points in a region
What is rock armor? | Large rocks or concrete blocks used as barriers to reduce marine erosion at cliff bases
What is saltation? | Transport method where smaller sediment bounces along the sea bed, pushed by currents
What is a salt marsh? | Area in sheltered bays where salt and minerals build up, often stabilized by vegetation
What is a sand dune? | Depositional landform where sand builds up around driftwood and accumulates over time
What is a sea wall? | Concrete wall built parallel to the seafront to redirect wave energy away from cliffs or coastal towns
What is soft management? | Using natural materials and sustainable approaches to reduce coastal erosion
What is solution (in coastal processes)? | Process where acidic water dissolves chemicals from rock, which are then transported as compounds
What is a storm hydrograph? | Graph showing variation of river discharge over a short period of time (days)
What is suspension? | Transport method where light materials float and are carried in water
What is a spit? | Long depositional landform formed from sand and shingle
What is a thalweg? | The path of fastest water flow in a river
What is traction? | Transport method where large rocks and boulders are rolled along the river or sea bed
