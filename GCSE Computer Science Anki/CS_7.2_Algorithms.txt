What is an input in an algorithm? | Data or information entered into a program before processing, from sources like users (keyboard, mouse) or sensors (temperature, pressure).
What is a process in an algorithm? | A doing action that transforms inputs into outputs, executed by the CPU (e.g., comparing numbers, calculating averages).
What is an output in an algorithm? | The result of processing that shows if an algorithm works as intended (e.g., numbers, text, images, or actions).
What are the inputs, processes, and outputs for calculating the area of a shape? | Inputs: Length, Width. Process: Length × Width. Output: Area.
What is a structure diagram? | A visual representation of problem decomposition that shows how a complex problem can be broken down into more manageable sub-problems.
What is the purpose of a structure diagram? | A planning tool for developers during problem analysis that helps break down complex problems into manageable sub-problems.
What is pseudocode? | A text-based tool using short English words/statements to describe an algorithm, more structured than English but flexible.
What is OCR exam reference language? | The officially designed pseudocode used in OCR exams to keep them consistent, similar to Python syntax.
What is a flowchart? | A visual tool using shapes to represent different functions in an algorithm, showing data input/output, processes, decisions, and repetition.
What shapes are used in flowcharts for different operations? | Oval (start/end), rectangle (process), parallelogram (input/output), diamond (decision), arrows (flow of control).
What is a syntax error? | An error that breaks grammatical rules of a programming language and stops it from running (e.g., typos, missing brackets, incorrect operators).
What is a logic error? | Incorrect code that allows the program to run but produces incorrect output/results (e.g., incorrect operators, logical confusion, infinite loops).
What is a common way to find logic errors? | Using trace tables to test algorithms by recording the state at each step or iteration.
What makes logic errors difficult to identify? | They don't stop the program from running and may be difficult for the original programmer to spot.
What are examples of syntax errors? | Typos, missing/extra brackets or quotes, missing semicolons, invalid variable names, incorrect operators, incorrectly nested loops.
How would you fix this syntax error: "age = input("Enter age)"? | Add the missing closing quote: age = input("Enter age")
How would you fix this syntax error: "favNum == input("Enter favourite number")"? | Change the double equals to single equals sign: favNum = input("Enter favourite number")
What are examples of logic errors? | Incorrect use of comparison operators, logical operator confusion (AND for OR), looping one extra time, incorrect array indexing, using variables before assignment, infinite loops.
What's the logic error in: "if cost = 10 then"? | Using assignment (=) instead of comparison (==, >, <), should be "if cost > 10 then" or "if cost == 10 then"
When dealing with array indexing, what's a common logic error? | Forgetting that array indexing typically starts at 0, not 1.
What is a trace table? | A tool used to test algorithms for logic errors by recording the state at each step or iteration.
What can trace tables be used for? | Discovering algorithm purpose, recording state at each step, checking inputs/outputs/variables for correct values.
How do you use a trace table? | Execute each stage of the algorithm step by step, recording the values of variables after each step.
Why are trace tables useful for finding logic errors? | They allow systematic checking of each step's execution, revealing where calculations or logic may be incorrect.
What should you identify before creating an algorithm? | The inputs, processes, and outputs required for the problem.
What is algorithmic thinking? | Creating a set of precise step-by-step instructions that can solve a problem.
Why might you need to refine an algorithm? | To fix errors, improve efficiency, or add new features/requirements.
What's the relationship between pseudocode and Python in OCR exams? | OCR exam reference language is very similar to Python syntax, so you can write algorithms in Python for both sections of the exam.
