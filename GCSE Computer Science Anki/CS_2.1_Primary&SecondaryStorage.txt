What is primary storage? | Memory that holds data and instructions the CPU needs to access while the computer is on. It has fast access times but is typically volatile and has smaller capacity.
What are the characteristics of primary storage compared to secondary storage? | Primary storage is typically volatile (except ROM), has smaller capacity, and faster access times than secondary storage.
Why do computers need primary storage? | Because access times are much faster than secondary storage, which reduces time to complete operations like the Fetch-Execute Cycle.
What types of memory are used as primary storage? | RAM, ROM, Cache, and Registers.
What is RAM? | Random Access Memory - primary storage that holds data and instructions currently in use. It's volatile, fast, and read/write.
Is RAM volatile or non-volatile? | Volatile - contents are lost when power is turned off.
What data would a smart TV store in RAM? | Current channel being watched, current volume, running applications, data being buffered/downloaded, web browser data.
What is ROM? | Read Only Memory - primary storage that holds the first instructions a computer needs to start up (Bootstrap). It's non-volatile and read-only.
What does ROM contain? | ROM contains the BIOS (Basic Input Output System).
Is ROM volatile or non-volatile? | Non-volatile - contents are not lost when power is turned off.
Where is ROM located? | On the computer's motherboard.
How does ROM compare to RAM in terms of capacity? | ROM has a much smaller capacity than RAM.
What is virtual memory? | An extension of primary storage (RAM) located on secondary storage that is used when RAM is nearly full.
How does virtual memory work? | Programs and data not currently being executed are transferred to secondary storage and brought back to RAM when needed.
How does using virtual memory affect system performance? | It negatively impacts performance because accessing secondary storage is much slower than RAM.
How can you avoid using virtual memory? | Increase the size of RAM.
Why do computers need secondary storage? | For long-term storage of programs and data that are not currently in use, since ROM is read-only and RAM is volatile.
What are the characteristics of secondary storage? | Non-volatile, large capacity, slower than primary storage.
What are the main factors to consider when choosing secondary storage? | Capacity, speed, cost, portability, durability, and reliability.
What are the three main types of secondary storage? | Magnetic, solid state, and optical.
What is magnetic storage? | A type of non-volatile media that uses magnets (polarity) to store binary 0s and 1s.
What are the advantages of magnetic storage? | High capacity, low cost per gigabyte, and moderate read/write speed.
What are the disadvantages of magnetic storage? | Less durable (moving parts can get damaged), heavy & bulky (less portable), prone to mechanical failure, and noisy.
What is solid state storage? | A type of non-volatile media that uses electronic circuits to store binary 0s and 1s.
What are the advantages of solid state storage? | Very fast read/write access, high durability (no moving parts), good portability (small size), and silent operation.
What are the disadvantages of solid state storage? | Very high cost per gigabyte and limited read/write cycles.
What is optical storage? | A type of non-volatile media that uses lasers to burn the surface of a disk, creating pits and lands suitable for storing binary 0s and 1s.
What are the advantages of optical storage? | Very low cost per gigabyte, durable (no moving parts), portable (small size), and silent operation.
What are the disadvantages of optical storage? | Very low capacity, very slow read/write access, and prone to scratches.
What is a Hard Disk Drive (HDD)? | A magnetic storage device with capacity ranging from 500GB to 8TB for consumer-grade, with low cost per GB.
What is a Solid-State Drive (SSD)? | A solid state storage device with capacity ranging from 128GB to 2TB for consumer-grade, with high cost per GB.
What is a USB Flash Drive? | A solid state storage device with capacity ranging from 8GB to 256GB, with moderate cost per GB.
What are optical discs and their capacities? | CD (700MB), DVD (4.7GB-9GB), Blu-ray (25GB-50GB), all with low cost per disc.
When would magnetic storage (HDD) be most suitable for a school? | When the school needs high capacity for backups at a low cost per gigabyte.
When would solid state storage (SSD) be most suitable for a military laptop? | When durability, portability, and performance are priorities and cost is not a concern.
When would optical storage (Blu-ray) be most suitable for a game studio? | When distributing millions of copies of a new game where portability, durability, and low cost are important.
