What is computational thinking? | Solving problems that can be implemented by a computer system.
What are the three main principles of computational thinking? | Abstraction, Decomposition, and Algorithmic thinking.
What is abstraction? | The process of removing unnecessary details of a problem to focus on the important features to implement in a solution.
What are examples of abstraction in real life? | Computer games that simulate sports, flight simulators, maps of bus/train routes.
How is abstraction used in computer games? | By removing elements users don't need to consider while keeping the game visually appealing and fun to play.
What is decomposition? | The process of breaking down a large problem into a set of smaller problems.
What are the benefits of decomposition? | Smaller problems are easier to solve, can be solved independently, can be tested independently, and can be combined to produce a solution to the full problem.
How is decomposition used in computer games? | By breaking games into manageable chunks like levels, characters, and landscape that can be developed independently.
What is algorithmic thinking? | The process of creating step-by-step instructions to produce a solution to a problem.
What does algorithmic thinking require? | The use of abstraction and decomposition to identify each individual step.
What is a searching algorithm? | Precise step-by-step instructions that a computer can follow to efficiently locate specific data in datasets.
What are two common searching algorithms? | Binary search and Linear search.
What is a binary search? | A search algorithm that keeps halving a dataset by comparing the target value with the middle value, going left if smaller, right if bigger, until it finds the value or realizes it's not there.
What is required for a binary search to work? | The data must be in order (sorted).
How do you perform a binary search? | 1) Find the middle value, 2) Compare to target value, 3) If it matches, stop, 4) If middle value is bigger, search the left half, 5) If middle value is smaller, search the right half, 6) Repeat until found.
What is a linear search? | A search that starts with the first value in a dataset and checks every value one at a time until all values have been checked.
Does linear search require data to be sorted? | No, linear search can be performed even if values are not in order.
What are the advantages of binary search? | Fast for large datasets and efficient for repeated searches.
What are the disadvantages of binary search? | Dataset must be in order and it's more complex to implement.
What are the advantages of linear search? | Works on unsorted datasets, faster on very small datasets, and simple to understand and implement.
What are the disadvantages of linear search? | Slow for large datasets and inefficient as it starts at the beginning each time.
What is a sorting algorithm? | Precise step-by-step instructions that a computer can follow to sort data in datasets efficiently.
What are three common sorting algorithms taught at GCSE? | Bubble sort, Merge sort, and Insertion sort.
What is a bubble sort? | A simple sorting algorithm that starts at the beginning of a dataset and checks values in 'pairs', swapping them if they are not in the correct order.
What is a "pass" in bubble sort? | One full run of comparisons from beginning to end of the dataset.
How do you know when a bubble sort is complete? | When there are no more swaps to make (after a complete pass with no swaps).
What is a merge sort? | A sorting algorithm that uses 'divide and conquer' by dividing a dataset into smaller sub-datasets and merging them back together in the correct order.
What are the two main steps of merge sort? | Divide (split dataset into individual elements) and Conquer (merge sub-datasets together in correct order).
What is an insertion sort? | A sort that processes one item at a time by placing it in the correct position of an already sorted portion of the list.
How does insertion sort begin? | It takes the first value as the initial sorted list, then inserts subsequent values into their correct positions.
Can values move multiple positions in insertion sort? | Yes, values can move as many places as needed to be in the correct position.
