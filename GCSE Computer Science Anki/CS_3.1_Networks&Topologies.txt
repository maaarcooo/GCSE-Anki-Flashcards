What is a network? | Two or more devices connected together with the purpose of sharing resources.
What are the two main types of networks? | Local Area Networks (LANs) and Wide Area Networks (WANs).
What is a Local Area Network (LAN)? | A network with a small geographical area (under 1 mile) where all hardware is owned by the company/organization/household using it.
What is a Wide Area Network (WAN)? | A network with a large geographical area (over 1 mile) that consists of multiple LANs joined together via routers.
What connection types are typically used in LANs? | Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cable, fiber optic cable, or wireless connections (Wi-Fi).
What connection types are typically used in WANs? | Fiber optic cable, telephone lines, and satellite connections.
What are four advantages of having a network? | Sharing resources (printers/internet), accessing files from any computer, easier communication, centralized backups/updates/security.
What are four disadvantages of having a network? | Increased security risk, vulnerability to malicious software, central points of failure, performance issues with many users.
What are the five key factors that affect network performance? | Number of users, bandwidth, latency, error rate, and transmission media.
How does the number of users affect network performance? | Too many users can cause the network to slow down if there isn't enough bandwidth for all data being sent/received.
What is bandwidth in networking terms? | The amount of data that can be sent and received at any given time, measured in bits per second.
What is latency in networking? | The delay between data being sent and received.
What is error rate in networking? | The measure of how many packets of data do not reach their destination.
How does transmission media affect network performance? | Different types of cables offer different bandwidth and speed capacities (fiber optic has higher bandwidth than copper cabling).
What is a network model? | The logical structure of the network that defines how it will operate on top of the physical network structure.
What is a client-server network model? | A network where clients (regular computers) connect to more powerful servers that provide services like internet access, printing, email, backups, and security.
What is a peer-to-peer network model? | A network where all computers are equal, with no server providing services, and each peer is responsible for its own files, security, and backups.
What are three advantages of client-server networks? | Easier centralized backups, centralized software updates/installation, easier security management.
What are three disadvantages of client-server networks? | Expensive servers, need for specialist network manager, servers as single points of failure.
What are three advantages of peer-to-peer networks? | Easy to set up/maintain, cheap (no expensive hardware), no specialist knowledge required.
What are two disadvantages of peer-to-peer networks? | Users must manage their own backups/updates, less secure than client-server networks.
What is the purpose of a router? | Routes data packets between different networks, connects LANs to WANs, assigns IP addresses, and manages data traffic.
What is the purpose of a Wireless Access Point (WAP)? | Allows wireless devices to connect to a LAN.
What is the purpose of a switch? | Allows multiple wired devices to connect to a LAN and intelligently routes data to the correct device.
What is the purpose of a Network Interface Card (NIC)? | Allows a computer to connect to a network and send/receive data.
What are the three main types of transmission media? | Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP), Coaxial, and Fiber Optic.
Which transmission media has the highest bandwidth but is most expensive? | Fiber optic.
Which transmission media is most commonly found in LANs due to affordability? | Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP).
What is the Internet? | A collection of networks spanning the whole world (the most well-known WAN).
What is the difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web? | The Internet provides connectivity between networks; the World Wide Web is the collection of webpages accessed via a web browser.
What is a Domain Name System (DNS)? | A directory that translates human-readable domain names to numeric IP addresses that computers use.
What is the role of an Internet Service Provider (ISP)? | Provides internet services to users and connects to the DNS.
What are web servers? | Dedicated servers that store websites and resources, with dedicated IP addresses for 24/7 access.
What is the cloud? | A collection of servers used to store data, applications, and files over the internet.
What are two advantages of cloud storage? | Access content from anywhere/anytime, large storage capacity available.
What are two disadvantages of cloud storage? | Requires internet connection, vulnerable to security threats.
What is a network topology? | The physical structure of the network that defines how the hardware is arranged.
What is a star topology? | A network structure with a central switch that all other devices connect to.
What is the main advantage of a star topology? | If any single cable fails, the rest of the network continues to work.
What is the main disadvantage of a star topology? | The central switch is a single point of failure - if it breaks, the entire network stops working.
What is a full mesh topology? | A network structure where all computers are connected to all other computers.
What is the main advantage of a mesh topology? | If any cable fails, data can find alternative routes to reach its destination.
What is the main disadvantage of a full mesh topology? | Requires lots of hardware and cables, making it expensive and harder to scale.
What is a partial mesh topology? | A compromise where not every device connects to every other device, but multiple routes still exist between devices.
