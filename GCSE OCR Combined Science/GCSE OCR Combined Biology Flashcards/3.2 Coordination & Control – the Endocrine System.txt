What is a hormone? | A chemical substance produced by a gland and carried by the blood, which alters the activity of specific target organs.
What is the endocrine system? | The collection of glands that produce hormones in animals.
Which hormone does the pituitary gland produce and what is its role? | The pituitary gland is the "master gland" that produces multiple hormones to control other glands.
What hormone does the thyroid gland produce? | Thyroxine.
What hormone do the adrenal glands produce? | Adrenaline.
What hormone does the pancreas produce? | Insulin.
What hormone do the testes produce? | Testosterone (male sex hormone).
What hormones do the ovaries produce? | Oestrogen and progesterone (female sex hormones).
What is the role of adrenaline? | Readies the body for a 'fight or flight' response by increasing heart and breathing rate.
What is the role of insulin? | Lowers blood glucose levels by causing excess glucose to be taken up by muscles and liver and converted into glycogen for storage.
What is the role of testosterone? | Main sex hormone in males; causes development of secondary sexual characteristics in males.
What is the role of progesterone? | Maintains pregnancy by maintaining the uterus lining to cushion fertilised egg and allow it to develop.
What is the role of oestrogen? | Main sex hormone in females; causes development of secondary sexual characteristics in females and controls menstrual cycle.
Why do endocrine glands have a good blood supply? | To get hormones into the bloodstream quickly so they can travel to target organs.
How do hormones affect only specific cells? | Hormones only affect cells with target receptors that are complementary to the hormone, found on cell membranes or inside cells.
What regulates hormone levels in the blood? | The liver transforms or breaks down excess hormones.
How do hormones compare to the nervous system in speed? | Hormones are slower than nervous impulses.
How do hormones compare to the nervous system in duration of effect? | Hormones act for longer than nervous impulses.
What type of message does the nervous system send? | Electrical impulses.
What type of message does the endocrine system send? | Chemical hormones.
What is testosterone responsible for in males? | Stimulates sperm production, growth of body hair, growth of penis and testes, muscle development, and deepening of voice.
What physical changes does oestrogen cause in females? | Breast development, widening of hips, growth of body hair, and beginning of menstrual cycle.
What is the role of FSH (follicle stimulating hormone)? | Stimulates the maturation of an egg in the ovary.
What is the role of LH (luteinising hormone)? | Responsible for ovulation of the egg once matured.
How long is the average menstrual cycle? | 28 days.
How long does menstruation typically last? | Around 5-7 days.
On which day does ovulation typically occur? | Around day 14 (halfway through the cycle).
Where is FSH produced? | The pituitary gland in the brain.
Where is LH produced? | The pituitary gland in the brain.
Where is oestrogen produced? | The ovaries.
Where is progesterone produced? | Specifically by an empty egg follicle called the corpus luteum.
What does FSH stimulate the production of? | Oestrogen.
What does oestrogen do to the uterus lining? | Causes growth and repair of the lining of the uterus wall.
What does oestrogen inhibit? | The production of FSH.
What does high oestrogen levels stimulate? | The release of LH from the pituitary gland, which causes ovulation.
What happens to the follicle after ovulation? | It becomes a corpus luteum and starts producing progesterone.
What is the role of progesterone in the menstrual cycle? | Maintains the uterus lining (thickness of the uterus wall).
What happens if the egg is not fertilised? | The corpus luteum breaks down, progesterone levels drop, and menstruation occurs.
What happens to progesterone if fertilisation occurs? | The corpus luteum continues to produce progesterone, preventing the uterus lining from breaking down.
What produces progesterone during pregnancy after the placenta develops? | The placenta secretes progesterone throughout pregnancy to maintain the lining.
How do oral contraceptives prevent pregnancy? | They contain hormones to inhibit FSH production so no eggs mature.
What hormones does the combined pill contain? | Oestrogen and progesterone.
How effective is the combined pill? | Over 99% effective at preventing pregnancy.
How does high oestrogen in the combined pill work? | It inhibits FSH production, preventing maturation and release of eggs.
What is the mini-pill? | A progesterone-only pill with fewer side effects.
How do contraceptive injections, implants or skin patches work? | They slowly release progesterone to inhibit maturation and release of eggs for months or years.
What is a benefit of contraceptive implants? | They reduce the chance of forgetting to take the pill daily.
What does a plastic IUD (intrauterine device) do? | Produces progesterone which stimulates production of thick mucus preventing sperm from reaching eggs.
How does a condom work? | Latex sheath worn over the penis that prevents sperm entering the vagina.
What additional benefit do condoms provide? | They protect against STIs (sexually transmitted infections).
How does a diaphragm work? | A rubber cap that fits over the entrance to the cervix, preventing sperm entry into uterus.
What is often used with a diaphragm? | A spermicide (cream which kills sperm).
What is natural family planning? | Avoiding sexual intercourse during the fertile period of the menstrual cycle when ovulation occurs.
What is the only 100% effective method of preventing pregnancy? | Complete abstinence (avoiding sexual intercourse completely).
What happens during a vasectomy? | The sperm ducts are cut, meaning no sperm is present in semen when ejaculation occurs.
What happens during female sterilisation (tubal ligation)? | The oviducts are cut or tied off, preventing eggs from reaching the uterus or sperm from reaching eggs.
What is a disadvantage of surgical contraception methods? | They are very effective but difficult to reverse.
What are common side effects of hormonal contraception? | Headaches, irregular/painful/heavy periods, acne, mood/energy changes, and weight gain.
Which contraceptive method protects against STIs? | Only condoms provide a barrier to STIs.
What effectiveness rating do sterilisation methods have? | 99%+ (assuming perfect use).
What effectiveness rating do barrier methods have? | 98% (condom), 95% (femidom), 94% (diaphragm).
What effectiveness rating does abstinence have? | 100% (A) if complete; 99% (FP) for natural family planning.
Why might fertility treatments be needed? | When couples find it difficult to conceive naturally.
How can hormones promote natural pregnancy in infertile women? | FSH is given to stimulate egg maturation and LH is given to stimulate ovulation.
What is a risk of hormone fertility treatment? | Several eggs may be released at once, increasing the chance of multiple births.
What does IVF stand for? | In Vitro Fertilisation ('in vitro' means 'in glass').
How does IVF work? | FSH and LH stimulate egg production, eggs are harvested and inseminated in a petri dish with sperm, then embryos are implanted in the uterus.
Why are several embryos implanted during IVF? | To increase the chance of one developing further.
What are two issues with IVF? | It is relatively expensive and has a high risk of multiple births.
