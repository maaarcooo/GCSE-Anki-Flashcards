What are autotrophs? | Organisms that can make their own food from simple molecules (carbon dioxide and water).
What is the word equation for photosynthesis? | Carbon dioxide + Water → Glucose + Oxygen (in the presence of light and chlorophyll)
What is the balanced chemical equation for photosynthesis? | 6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂
Where does photosynthesis take place? | In chloroplasts (specialised sub-cellular structures).
What is the role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis? | To absorb as much light energy as possible.
Is photosynthesis endothermic or exothermic? | Endothermic (energy is transferred from the environment to chloroplasts by light).
What happens in the first stage of photosynthesis? | Light energy splits water into oxygen gas and hydrogen ions.
What happens in the second stage of photosynthesis? | Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere combines with hydrogen ions to make glucose.
Where does carbon dioxide enter the leaf? | Through the stomata (diffuses into the leaf).
Where does water come from for photosynthesis? | Taken up by the roots and transported through the xylem to the leaves.
What are the three main factors affecting photosynthesis rate? | Light intensity, carbon dioxide concentration, and temperature.
Why is water not considered a limiting factor for photosynthesis? | There is usually enough water available for photosynthesis.
Can chlorophyll be a limiting factor? | Yes, disease or environmental stress (like lack of nutrients) can affect chlorophyll levels.
How does temperature affect photosynthesis? | Increasing temperature increases kinetic energy and collision rate, but very high temperatures denature enzymes.
What happens to photosynthesis rate at very high temperatures? | The rate decreases because enzymes become denatured (active site changes shape).
How does light intensity affect photosynthesis rate? | The more light a plant receives, the faster the rate of photosynthesis (until another factor becomes limiting).
How does carbon dioxide concentration affect photosynthesis? | More carbon dioxide present increases the reaction rate (until another factor becomes limiting).
What does it mean when a graph of photosynthesis rate levels off? | Another factor has become limiting and is preventing further increase in rate.
[Higher Tier] At 15°C and 25°C, why do the rates initially increase at the same rate with light intensity? | Both temperatures are limited by low light intensity initially.
[Higher Tier] In the three-factor experiment graph, why does Experiment 1 (red line) have the highest rate? | It has the highest temperature (25°C) and highest CO₂ concentration (0.4%).
[Higher Tier] What does the inverse square law describe? | The relationship between light intensity and distance from the light source.
[Higher Tier] What is the equation for the inverse square law? | Light intensity = 1/distance²
[Higher Tier] If distance from a light source doubles, what happens to light intensity? | Light intensity becomes four times less.
[Higher Tier] Calculate light intensity when distance is 30 cm from the lamp. | Light intensity = 1/30² = 0.001 arbitrary units
Why are plants called producers in food chains? | They make glucose (complex molecules) from simple molecules, storing energy in biomass that flows through the food chain.
What is biomass? | The mass of living material (made from complex molecules that help plants grow).
How do photosynthetic organisms support life on Earth? | They help support nearly all life on Earth by providing energy through food chains.
What can glucose produced by photosynthesis be used for? | As a source of energy in cellular respiration or to make more complex molecules for growth.
Where is most photosynthesis maximised in plants? | In specialised mesophyll cells packed with chloroplasts in the leaves.
What does oxygen produced in photosynthesis do? | It diffuses out of the leaf through the stomata or is used in respiration.
Do plants respire as well as photosynthesise? | Yes, plants both respire and photosynthesise.
