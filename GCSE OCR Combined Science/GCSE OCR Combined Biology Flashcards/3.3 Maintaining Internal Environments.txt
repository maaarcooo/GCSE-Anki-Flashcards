What is homeostasis? | The regulation of the internal conditions of a cell or organism to maintain optimum conditions for enzyme action and healthy cell functions.
Name 5 examples of internal conditions controlled by homeostasis. | Water content, body temperature, pH, blood pressure, blood glucose concentration.
What type of control maintains homeostasis in the body? | Involuntary (automatic) control via the brain stem and spinal cord.
What are the 3 components of all homeostatic control systems? | Receptors (detect stimuli), coordination centres (process information), effectors (bring about responses).
What is negative feedback? | A control mechanism where an increase in a factor causes the body to decrease it, and vice versa, keeping levels within a narrow range.
What is the consequence if homeostatic limits are exceeded? | The organism may die.
What is glucoregulation? | The regulation of blood glucose concentration in the blood.
Why must blood glucose be kept within a narrow range? | Excessively high levels cause cells to lose water by osmosis; excessively low levels deprive the brain of glucose for respiration, potentially causing coma or death.
Which two organs regulate blood glucose levels? | The pancreas and the liver.
What does insulin do? | Stimulates cells (particularly liver and muscle cells) to take in glucose from the bloodstream.
What happens to excess glucose in liver and muscle cells? | It is converted into glycogen (a polymer of glucose) for storage.
What is Type 1 diabetes? | A disorder where the pancreas fails to produce sufficient insulin to control blood glucose levels.
What causes Type 1 diabetes? | The immune system destroys the cells of the pancreas that make insulin during development.
How is Type 1 diabetes treated? | With insulin injections.
What is Type 2 diabetes? | A condition where body cells no longer respond properly to insulin produced by the pancreas (insulin resistance).
What is a major risk factor for Type 2 diabetes? | Obesity, often due to a diet high in carbohydrates leading to insulin over-production and resistance.
How is Type 2 diabetes commonly treated? | With a carbohydrate-controlled diet and an exercise regime.
Why doesn't insulin treatment work for Type 2 diabetes? | Because the cells are resistant to insulin, so additional insulin makes no difference to symptoms.
What is glucagon? (Higher Tier) | A hormone secreted by the pancreas that converts glycogen stored in the liver into glucose.
What happens when blood glucose gets too low? (Higher Tier) | The pancreas secretes glucagon, which causes the liver to convert glycogen to glucose and release it into the blood.
What happens when blood glucose gets too high? (Higher Tier) | The pancreas secretes insulin, which stimulates muscles and liver to take up glucose from the bloodstream and store it as glycogen.
What is a fever? | When body temperature exceeds 37.5°C.
At what temperature does hyperthermia develop? | At 38.3°C or more.
Name 3 symptoms of hyperthermia. | Tiredness/dizziness/headaches, low blood pressure, muscle cramps, heavy sweating, intense thirst, dark coloured urine, nausea.
Name 3 treatments for hyperthermia. | Move to a cool place, lie down and raise legs, drink fluids (rehydration drinks), apply cool flannels or spray with cool water.
What is hypothermia? | When body temperature drops below 35°C.
Name 3 symptoms of hypothermia. | Shivering, slow breathing, slurred speech, tiredness, pale skin, low energy.
Name 3 treatments for hypothermia. | Warm the patient slowly, remove wet clothes and wrap in dry blankets, provide shelter indoors, give warm sugary drinks (non-alcoholic).
What is dehydration? | When the body loses more water than it takes in.
Name 3 symptoms of dehydration. | Feeling thirsty, dry mouth, tiredness, dizziness, small volumes of concentrated dark coloured urine.
How is dehydration treated? | Consuming more water and intake of salts to replace those lost through sweating.
What is water intoxication? | A dangerous condition caused by consuming too much water, leading to swelling in the body, particularly the brain.
Name 3 symptoms of water intoxication. | Headaches, personality/behavioural changes, irritation, disorientation, confusion, drowsiness, nausea.
What are serious consequences of water intoxication? | Seizure, brain damage, coma, or death.
How is water intoxication treated? | Reduce fluid intake and use diuretics to increase urine production.
What is hypernatremia? | High salt levels in the body, occurring due to excessive salt intake or increased water loss.
Name 3 symptoms of excess salt intake. | Thirst, confusion, muscle twitching, fatigue.
What are serious consequences of hypernatremia? | Seizures, bleeding in the brain, kidney damage or kidney failure.
How is excess salt intake treated? | Careful control of fluid and sodium intake; in serious cases, intravenous supply of balanced fluids.
Which groups are at higher risk from excess salt intake? | Diabetics, babies, and the elderly.
